Kia Seltos is Superb car with excellent technology. A very nice car in this segment with all the attractive features. Also, t is the most selling after lunch.
Kia Seltos is a good luxury vehicle at Valuable rate. Extraordinary front DRLS and headlight lamps. Good build quality with attractive look getting in this car. Impressing interiors provided by the brand in this car.
Firstly I think Creta is the best car in the mid SUV segment but when Kia launches its beast nothing other than Seltos. It crosses over every mid-range SUVs in the aspect of performance, looks, power, features, and many more features getting in this car.
Best features and look at, best engine performance and my favorite car in 2019.
Great build quality comfort is highest on its segment You can change lanes at 140 kmph too. It feels like a heavy car but gives confidence on the road.
Best car of the year, awesome design, good space, and interior also. Good performance was amazing with BS6 engine.

Kia Seltos is not so attractive in terms of look but still most of the people like it. I rated this car at 4.5. 
Kia Seltos has all the best feature in this price range. It is a very attractive look and the most demanding car in this segment.
Seltos, in the price, is a very good car someone can get. Everything in it is pretty good but being a new company, the after-sales service that you'll get may leave you unsatisfied. Also, suspension in it is a bit on the harder side, it pumps back the vehicle and this is the only reason I've given it 4 stars because when we buy a car, with power, looks and features we tend to find comfort, which is a major reason of selecting a particular car. Yet the tyres used are too slim in such a heavy vehicle and after paying a huge amount of money. This doesn't give the feel of drive which you can get in some other vehicles in the same price range. So I'd say you can check other vehicles too if you're looking for a MUV at this range. Prolly Hector will be the best with head on head with Creta.
The stylish look of this car attracts so much to the people this car is impressive in its own way such a gangsta feeling when I see it moving in fast speed the interior of this car is so much classy This car gives you a royal feeling while driving and limbs of this car are excellent seats are also so comfortable this car in mid-range makes it attract more people so definitely buy this car!
Worth Buying it. Value for money. Fully loaded with next-level features (in comparison to prevailing features in the market). Great mileage is there so you can take it to a longer distance and do good off-roading. Available in exciting colors. After-sales service is also good. If you people are looking for compact SUV that it will be one of the best options amongst Hyundai Creta and MG Hector.
Seltos is near perfect vehicle by many angles. Its design is fantastic, looks are fantastic, features are fantastic, refinement is excellent, ride quality is superb and easily comparable to my Innova Crysta, diesel manual mileage is excellent, seat comfort is superb.
The very impressive driving experience such a cool SUV at a very affordable rate. The off-road drive experience is also much better. Finally a super feature car in the Indian market.
The front end of the Seltos is particularly impressive. The huge Tiger Nose grille is Kia's design trademark, has a knurled aluminium finish, with a contrasting black plastic grille. Pair this with large sweeping headlights and turn indicators, along with vertically placed fog lamps, and the Seltos cuts a fine figure, with imposing road presence.
Best car, luxury car in the small budget, this is the wonderful experience best car in the world.
This car is amazing, I love the drive quality and when driving the interior design of the car is very super and the car is very nice.
It's really hard to explain, I think its good for a middle-class family and it looks like a luxury one.
I had driven my Seltos of around 10000 km and still, it is very smooth and fun to drive I am very happy with my decision.
The interior is excellent with cam, seating, and advanced technology. The Kia Seltos also comes with ventilated seats, 2-step reclining rear seats, electric sunroof, push-button start, electrically adjustable driver's seat, auto climate control, keyless entry, and a 360-degree camera. The safety tech adds six airbags, ABS with EBD, front and rear parking sensors, ESP, hill hold control and blind view monitor. The car uses advanced high strength steel in its construction for improved safety.
Best car, stylish, futuristic and fantastic car. I like this car very much. It has good mileage and also has a great engine. It's tiger-nose grill is so good. It gives a bold look to the car. It's bose infotainment system is very very good. The response of the touch screen is so fast. In Seltos, Kia gives a lot of features at a very good price.
The best you can have out of mid-class SUV, the interior is just ravishing like exterior and compliment each other, boss music system is par excellence. My favourite colour is white with black out roof and GT line has its own charm with HUD(heads up display). Only holding back is that it's available in petrol, I hope soon diesel version would be here in GT.
It has a premium interior. Its exterior is muscular and looks more than a compact SUV. It's loaded with features and the car is a value for money.
Kia Seltos is a great car. Having fully loaded features of next-generation and the best thing about it is the looks those DRLs which glow all the way from left to right. Even the engine power is best in class. Which could be easily seen on the roads nowadays and on their booking lists. The Kia motors gave a tough competition. It shook the whole market with its Seltos. The only thing I didn't like is the logo it should be somewhat different.
Its design is fantastic, looks are fantastic, features are fantastic, refinement is excellent, NVH levels are superb, ride quality is superb and diesel manual mileage is excellent, seat comfort is superb. The back seat of this vehicle occupies 3 people comfortably.
Very feature loaded vehicle that blows your mind and very useful in day to day life. Comfort level is also great at this price point.
The engine is smooth, strong and very likable. Also, the 7-speed dual-clutch auto that is responsive and quick to shift. overall value for money.
Nice car, comfortable to drive at this price range and with such a big display loves the features.
Nice car with power delivery. Nice Led tail lamps. It gives you pleasure while driving. You can blindly opt for this car. 
I tried to ignore writing a review of the car. But the quality, performance and overall comfort of the car forced me to do so. I am here writing about Kia Seltos. Using this car for a bit now with decent 10000km on record. The car will not at all disappoint you in terms of pickup and driving comfort. The seats hold you so well and on top of it the response that you get from the steering. Really impressed. I have also driven another SUV's like Creta, Nissan kicks Mahindra XUV. But Kia has really made its presence and you will feel that in every term of the car. Drove the car on hilly terrain and the motor inside it gives you that punch even if driving on a steep upward hill. No power lag nothing. It's worth buying no second thoughts to look around. Best in class.
The best car of 2019 hands down. The features and the price is beyond the world, love everything about it. Especially the heads-up display and the sunroof. All the variants are BS6 compliant and all of the variants of the car are nicely put up and all of them are feature-loaded too. The lights on the cars look like something else completely and it's distinct from every other car. 100/100 to Kia Seltos.
Excellent car for India. Whomsoever wants to buy a car, please go for this car definitely you will enjoy and also the best price with a luxury experience.
It is a very well built car with value for money proposition. It also comes loaded with best in class features, some of which are first in its segment and most importantly it is the safest car available in its segment. It is also the most attractive and stylish car with a lot of youth appeal and is bound to turn a lot of eyeballs on the road.
The price-performance ratio is better than MG, Creta and other opponents as its size and modern features are very reliable. The wireless charger is also not a common feature. Its infotainment system is of Bose which is commendable. Also, it's an affordable car of its segment.
Excellent car in the market. Has shaken the automobile market by its features and performance. The biggest competitor in the field of automobiles.
Runs smoothly and has great looks.
Super looks and excellent engine. Better experience at a lower price.
Amazing car with new technology updates and runs smoothly.
In one word it's a superb car. The interior and exterior both are superb and have a good suspension. Good space, color combination is also good and look-wise it's superb. The driving experience is ultimate so far. Highly recommended.
Very wonderful design and technical development are too high this type of car, and also so many features available in the vehicle, more options and more model, vehicle looking is good. I'm seen the car at road very nice and fantastic road presence, one of the my lovely car of this segment, thanks to KIA motors I'm waiting for next Carnival car, also need your finances scheme and offer for upcoming month because of India people's expected in this type of offers, Fall in Love this car, thanks for legend Kia motor, one of the day I'm seeing a wonderful day, and also provide low-level price in this market please let me know if you best in Seltos car, love you Seltos love you so much buddy.
I am proud of the owner of the Kia Seltos HTK+ petrol variant, it is the most comfortable car in its segment as well as has great driving and handling characteristics. Kia has provided all the necessary features at a competitive price but I feel that it should have provided some features like armrest and charging port for rear passengers too in this particular model. Overall it is a great car and could have improved in the back seat experience at this price.
This is the most beautiful car, The design of the Kia Seltos is much richer and newer than other SUV vehicles in India, as well as being sporty. Very good quality has been used in this. Its front is a quite bold while from the side and back it looks quite premium.
The car's performance is superb and its engine is so powerful. It's interior is luxurious and runs smoothly.
5he car nice spacious. The infotainment system is also great .the first in segment thing is the air 1uality control system and the bs6 engine.
Nice look & features as well. Not all good features available in all the top models. Hi-tech. support features.
The best car made by Kia. Seltos give excellent performance and also well comfort. The look of the car is also beautiful.
Excellent car with top-notch features. Best in its class driving experience. High comfort level and space.
It's a brilliant 5 seated car with heavy power and excellent fuel mileage. It's look is pretty awesome.
Great car to drive and good proportions. There is less body roll at the back. Superb interiors and great tech inside. I heard quite a few comments that servicing is not that great but I have never experienced such an issue. Overall it's good.
This car is a very wonderfully design by Kia motors. Its headlights are very attractive and the front view of the car is very amazing. Kia Motors are giving the best function in this car of a 360-degree rotating parking camera with sunroof and also 6 airbags. The wooden finish in the interior of this car is very fabulous. Very luxurious sitting in the car.
Superb car, it will be a good experience to drive a car like this and it will be ruling on Indian Road in the future. The taught of innovation to make this car for Indians very thankful. The technology used in this car is best for the price tag they have. The shape is the perfect SUV in the market. The LED lights front light everything is perfectly clear and the interior of the car is very much impressive. The much-needed car of the Indian road is Kia Seltos.
Excellent car specification, head-lamp display, alloy wheels are very good and the design is amazing.
Kia Seltos is a great car with good mileage, low maintenance cost and fully feature-loaded car. Amazing body design and perfect interior getting in this car.
Good ride quality, refined engine, and 1.4 petrol motor is a blast to drive. Build quality gives a premium feel. Nice and spacious cabin well-built car.
Nice and bold car Kia Seltos. Looking beautiful, nice shapes and aggressive looks. 
Best car with high end features in a medium budget. When this car was launched in India it beat the Tata Harrier and MG Hector but it has a common exterior design that looks like Creta. It doesn't give a fresh look. Peopld liked it because of high features in this car with some more expenses. Due to high sales in India, this company became India's fifth automobile company.
Kia is an affordable product for SUV lovers. If we are comparing Kia Seltos or Creta so Kia will definitely wins this segment.
Kia Seltos is a nice car. Also getting very nice interior and exterior in this vehicle.  
Kia Seltos is a very excellent car, as it offers much more features than other cars in this price range, but its top-end model is not value for money because it offers the smaller engine as compared to its rivals.
Kia Seltos is an excellent car with excellent features. It has powerful A.C., great cabin space with impressive 1.4ltr GT petrol engine.
Nice car,  Kia did an outstanding job making this car reliable and most superior for Indian market it really showed the future of modern mobility with its internet features along with the worlds first built in-car air purifier. It takes the lead and it is seriously going to be trust by every Indian.
Worst experience with Kia Seltos, there is no drive modes in diesel automatic and not good safety features like airbags as it gives only 2 airbags in the top diesel model. Tata Harrier is giving 6 airbags.
  Kia Seltos's design and specifications are amazing. Kia Seltos is available at an affordable price. Hope one day I will buy this car. Welcome to India Kia Altos.
Kia Seltos price is too high if the top variant can below 16 lakh then it could be no.1. car in the segment. Desperately now hector will be no1 and Tata harrier is no2 and Kia Seltos is no 3 position.
I agree there are good features in Kia Seltos. New car of KIA but the price according to the product is very high, specification in the Diesel top end in which several features are also missing.
Kia Seltos is a very good car with good design. Features of the car made it more comfortable. Car is avilable at an affordable price that a middle class family can buy it. This is my dream car.
Kia Seltos is a good car for the family. The car has solid built quality.
Kia Seltos is an excellent car but lower variants should offer the same setup of lights as the top model otherwise outstanding car. It is a threat to Hyundai Creta.
Kia Seltos is an excellent looking car with great features.
After looking at 5 star hype on internet of Kia Seltos, today I took test drive for KIA seltos. Simply not super almost like Breeza design n same built quality. About interiors only top end has Bose Speakers other variants have normal ones. No cold glove box or light even in top end Seltos. Most of the parts are not imported and manufacture in AP that's why price is less. Diesel engine sounds like driving Tata Sumo. Test it and then decide. Now a days people are smart "Kam daam mein acha quality" To be frank I don't refer this seltos to anyone, 6 gears which will be definetly fuel consuming like i20.
It is the most luxurious and functional car. I had a test drive of this car, it was so silent to drive. I am impressed by the drive. And I also would like to thank the one who designed such a beautiful car.
The car is very attractive and bold. It is better than MG Hector and is available at a more cheaper price. I love this car.
Kia Seltos is a total disappointment for AMT buyers as HTX & GTX variant costs 18-18.5lakh on-road Mumbai (HTK+ variant Doesn't justify its 15lakh on-road Mumbai price tag). Better to opt for Creta AMT & save a lakh or wait for Tata harrier AMT & save some funds meanwhile.
Don't just go by books and promises. I seriously doubt automatic versions of Kia Seltos as mileage claimed versus actual performance may have a huge difference. I suspect that diesel won't give more than 10-11 km/l and petrol won't go beyond 9 km/l.    
Kia Seltos is best in its segment. Both the exterior and interior looks are amazing. On the basis of the price, we can say it is the best SUV in the Indian market.
Kia Seltos has really good looks. It has the best performance in its segment. Great Interiors and design as well. 
Car is amazing, it is the first car with an inbuilt air purifier, it has a beautiful interior. The alloys are super cool and also it has a very powerful engine.
Its amazing production is done by MG motor. Just loved it, at first sight, i will take it first ride as soon as possible.
This car has superb design and mileage could not be better than this. It has a rear design. In terms of design, it resembles Creta a little. 
Its Amazing and good looking SUV in this price range and its interior design is amazing and outer look is fabulous love it.
Nice car with super loaded features and both interior and exterior looking good. The car is fabulous, I really like this car.
Kia Seltos has great exterior and interior and it is the best car in this segment which you will get at a less price.
The car comes in really good and amazing looks. You will get a great car at a low price.
Kia is a good car with best features. And built-in with high performance. Comes with bose audio and it is a vehicle like Creta. It is not in a range of MG hector or Tata Harrier.
Kia's cars come with comparatively cheaper prices than of similar brands. But includes great looks and suspension in comparison to other cars of the segment. 
Seltos is the best car in its segment. There can not be any better car than this. Every feature is just mind-blowing. Strongly recommended.
The exterior and interior design are thought out for the Indian mind. The car scores on all fronts. The car is futuristic. It combines all the features at an affordable cost. Hope Kia motors provide good after-sales support and must make it easy (electronic) for the owners.
Kia Seltos is an amazing car in India. It is a wonderful vehicle which comes in classy looks and amazing features. I really love this car.
Kia Seltos is a complete package vehicle under mid-segment SUV. The best part is its impeccable features that the car has to offer. Bravo Kia.

Bought the Jeep Compass sport in august 2018. From Khatwani motors, Jabalpur. It is more of an SUV than a soft-roader. It has patchy dynamics but is a well-finished model with good off-road capabilities. The 4x2 mode has a good off road capabilities. Whereas the 4x4 has excellent off-road capabilities. The departure angle is excellent. The only issue is with the mileage. It does not give the promised average of 14km/l. It only gives around 10km/l on highway and around 6 km/ l in the city depending on the traffic. * Has a noisy engine which is the only disadvantage after mileage. The well-tied suspension, as well as cleverly distributed torque through the 4WD system, does make this is perfectly capable thing through corners, even ones with lots of crests and dips. The touch-screen is easy to navigate. The Apple CarPlay/Android Auto integration is pretty tight too. Just near the USB port is a handy mesh pocket to hold your phone. Overall I would like to give it 8 stars out of 10. It's an excellent SUV. I love to own an American ðŸš™
It's a great car. I have a Jeep Compass 2018 is a limited manual car. It was my dream to own. Till date, I haven't faced any problem. The power, handling, luxury feel, everything you get it for 20-25 lakhs is absolutely insane. More than that it's really suited to Indian road conditions. I never felt lethargic even after driving for 600+ km per day.
Jeep Compass is the most efficient car, elegantly designed, and most powerful car in this segment, compared to Harrier, Creta this is the most efficient and it's the best value for money. Excellent driving experience with all the necessary features required in this segment of car. If any confusion with similar cars, just go and get jeep compass blindly and buy. Its limited plus version it's the best value for money.
Too many issues with the clutch plates and 2.0 liters Fiat-sourced diesel engine is problematic and compelled me to get the clutch plates changed twice in just 4000kms.
Its been nearly 2 years of my Jeep Compass limited edition and I must say, it's just a completely fantastic car. The features are very good. Loved this car and its value for money. Maintenance is a bit high but the person who buys 5 seaters in this range does not feel it so.
Jeep Compass is a nice car loaded with more features cost is less, the interior looks very nice. Suitable in price best off-roading car, compact SUV, the car of the year, all segments colours looking very nice, engine very nice ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ , more powerful car, it is an also adventure car for off-roading, teren management system is very good.
I purchased Jeep Compass Limited Plus on 1st of July 2019 and within 15 days (vehicle has not even driven 500km out of which 300km on first day) lot of annoying sounds audible from the sunroof, dashboard, doors (maybe from C-pillar) and now from suspension. 
Jeep Compass is a great car because the dimensions of the car look brilliant and the pick-up of the car is tremendous.
The car has very high service costs and also requires regular service. It costs me 2 lacs plus in last 12 months. I would not suggest buying this as this cost is not justified with the performance of the car. Complaints are not monitored by the company. They really don't care for your concern.
Jeep Compass is a most likely car I drown till know. It is superb I mostly like is comfort I was driving to Kerala from my place I had not to feel tired at all.
Jeep Compass is an excellent SUV which scores on safety features and excellent all-round performance. Jeep Compass is an excellent highway cruiser. Jeep Compass comes with safety features such as traction control, rollover mitigation, ESP, Electronic Parking Brake, Hill Assist, Hill Descent Control as standard. Jeep compass build quality, interior design, and quality are top-notch. There are some pros and cons of Compass as follows:- PROS 1. Class-leading off-roading capabilities. 2. The diesel engine is extremely frugal and responsive. 4. Dominant seven-slat grille, the sharp proportions, and the rectangular arches have succeeded in catching the attention of many Indians. There are a lot of Compass customers in India who praise its design more than anything. 5. 6 Speed Manual Gearbox is very smooth. 6. Owing to off-road character, compass gets four driving modes in its Selec- Terrain all-wheel-drive system such as Auto, Snow, Sand, and Mud- the systems adjust the engine mapping and traction control to move easily over the selected terrain. 7. The individual Suspension set up of the jeep compass further increases its off-road capability. 8. Plastic quality and materials used on the compass are extremely superb and best in class. CONS 1. Missing some features. 2. Poor rear seat comfort feels claustrophobic and not good for three adults. 3. Too much expensive. 4. 7-speed DCT Automatic gearbox is not very smooth, quickest and lacks punch. 5. The petrol engine is noisy than other rivals such as Creta and hector. 6. The brakes are good, but while slowing down from high speeds it seems to lack the necessary bite for sharp and effective braking.
Jeep Compass is a very good car. It is an SUV under 20lacs. It has a touch screen infotainment system, legroom is also very good. It gives a luxurious look. The AC provides cooling very fast. Connectivity is also good. 5 people can be seated easily. I have Grey colour of it. It also has led DRLs. Boot space is also very spacious. Ground Clearance is also better. It feels nice while driving.
True to its tag line "GO ANYWHERE DO ANYTHING" Jeep Compass is the Best SUV in its segment. Super build quality and above all it provides the best driving pleasure. #jeeplife.
Beast in hand, the word for this is a perfect car, It can ruin any car on road weather its highway or city driving, the car is unmatched, using from last one month and every day is like the first day. Now the drawback time, bad fuel efficiency 7-8 KMPL, and the major drawback is initial power lag that will always surprise you. I have to go as per car demands not as you like, but a benefit is a manual option. I am enjoying my car like anything, after initial power lag that car become beast.
With a striking interior and exterior design, host of feel-good features and multiple powertrain options, jeep seems to have cut no corners in equipping its first offering for India.
I am not complaining for Jeep Compass but my reason for 4 stars is that of its pricing and maintenance. In the top model budget one can own a big car like Fortuner. Overall it is a good package but somewhere it has been differentiated from its own segment cars Just a status maintaining product but a good car .
I purchased the Jeep Compass limited plus model in May 2019. I drove this vehicle 7000 km only and it started creating problems like leaked diesel pump, engine problem such a 3rd class car it is.
The car has an awesome pick-up and comes with a marvelous look. It has full filled all my requirements, I love to drive this car especially off-roading and in hilly areas.
Jeep Compass - Premium is the other word for it. A comfortable and porch car. Thank you jeep.
Super nice look and interior also good.
The car is under a 3 year Warranty. But not Battery Not sure what more is not under warranty Average 9 km per liter of Petrol is a disaster as against 12 told while selling While buying the Showroom insurance rep asked me. 90000 plus, when I insisted on getting from outside, they dropped to. 58000 They charged me. 30000 for Nano paint and some not so useful or rather useless stuff as a package I'm not sure this vehicle will last for 5 years as against my Toyota Corolla which ran for 12 Year with not this kind of Drama and wrong commits Careful before you decide.
 Jeep Compass SUV is awesome, the comfort, driving pleasure, off-roading capabilities are top notch, no comparison of this SUV in this segment.
Hi I purchased Jeep Compass last year in July still 1year is not completed yet, and the car is creating so many problems in engine side like fuel pump failed and no parts available at service agency in Hyderabad. I suggest everyone not to buy Jeep Compass.
I am a pride owner of Jeep Compass limited plus 4x2. Buying this car is a good decision. I am glad about the performance of this car. I would surely recommend it. And if anyone is thinking to buy it go for it. Don't think of any harrier or hector. Compass is famous for its premium quality.
Initially, I was a bit hesitant about Jeep Compass, but after months of usage, it feels great to own such a machine. High in power and styling, pure driving pleasure. Bit expensive but justified after checking competitors in the market.
BUYING OF JEEP COMPASS IS A GOOD DECISION. JEEP IS POWERFUL, NICE ON HIGHWAYS BUT BRAKING IS SUDDEN AND DRIVING IN CITY TRAFFIC IS NOT EASY. MY PETROL JEEP IS GIVING MILEAGE OF 10 KM/LTR INSTEAD OF 16 KM/LTR WHICH NEEDS TO BE CHECKED AND I MADE COMPLAINT AT SERVICE CENTER BUT NO SATISFACTORY REPLY / ACTION. AFTER SALES SERVICE IS GOOD EXCEPT MILEAGE PROBLEM.
Jeep Compass is an ultimate SUV. Totally satisfied with my licence to off-road. The only drawback is less backspace. Unmatched power.
I just owned Jeep Compass, and I loved it. It's not a car but its the best option in this price range.
The darling car of my life. Great to have such a wonderful car drive feature and beauty is excellent.
My dream car The best of look and ahead of all cars Its stunning look is attractive and a lot...
I suggest Jeep Compass 1.4 Longitude option for a man looking for a perfect value for money. It has all features comparing to the top end model with 7-speed automatic transmission.
CAR... OMG ITS A BEAST...It's NOT JUST A CAR IT IS AN ULTIMATE ROARER......THE POWER, THE HANDLING, THE SUSPENSIONS, THE LOOKS, THE BODY....IT'S TOTALLY AN AMAZING BEAUTY AND A BEAST.....IT IS MORE THAN THE BEST...LOVE THIS CAR.....ITS INTERIORS ARE AMAZING...IT GIVES A FEEL OF THE MOST EXPENSIVE CARS, LUXURIOUS AND COMFORTABLE. ALSO, IT HAS AN OUTSTANDING PERFORMANCE WHEN IT COMES TO OFF-ROADING
Pure driving pleasure. The vehicle is incomparable to any of it?s class. 173ps of horse power kills it all. Top speed at 205kmph, the torque and speed are enormous after second gear. A very stable vehicle at high speeds and McPherson strut shock absorbers just smoothens the ride at all terrain. If you looking up for a long drive this vehicle is just meant for you. I have driven this vehicle for 25,000kms in 6 months and never has there been an issue. Plus, the ride is so amazing I have literally stopped going via flights.
I have purchased Jeep Compass automatic last August and it has been wonderful experience till now be it its performance features drivability and comfort level everything is top notch and I would say pricing is quite impressive too. I am very much satisfied with the SUV overall and recommend it for purchase.
It's is the best SUV car the best in segment and powerful I had a great experience and it's not a car it's a human thing.
am regretfully informing you that the jeep compass longitude petrol, I purchased on 26 February 2019 from your agency is showing electrical fault ''BREK LIGHT OUT '' FROM THE DAY IT DELIVERED I manage d to send the vehicle twice pathway from Bhopal to your workshop but unfortunately they failed to rectify the problem as the backlights are still not working. It causes me financial loss as well as my wasted my precious time. Now I am going back without rectification. please look into it otherwise I left with no option except a legal remedy. an early reply will be solicited.
We bought a Jeep Compass in Jan 2018. Its May 2019 and the battery died. There is no warranty! I'm shocked! Does battery die in a 1.5 yrs? We have had a Honda city for 12 yrs now and never had issues. Don't buy the Jeep unless you are willing to sign up for battery failure in a yr!!! Apparently, it's a common problem!!!! Also, any part issues â€” be willing to wait for 2-3 weeks!!! Disappointed!
In Love with confidence Jeep Compass gives when driving at high-speed due to its exceptional Control & its safety technologies which help in controlling the vehicle at all possible conditions. Now, as it is a Jeep, so I do take it for weekend trails, where its off road capability is really amazing. I Own the limited Plus 4Ã—4 variant which has everything what i would expect when even I am Considering X1 X line/Xc40/Q3 with quarto technology. I have started taking time for myself for adventure trip. It's not just a Product, it carries Jeep legacy. Please don't Compare Jeep with Tata/Hyundai/MG. MG is coming up with lots of features as showing in internet...but certainly MG as a brand has no history of off road Capability, also when it Comes to tough terrains Cosmetics Doesn't take out further. Believe in Legends & drive one. Jeep stands above all.
An absolute beast. Love the car in every aspect. Has a powerful engine and great drivability. The material used in the interiors is of absolutely premium quality. If you're looking for a great quality car and are really passionate about what you drive, go for Jeep Compass without any second thought.
The car is "Jack of all trades" 18'inch wheelbase, EBV instead of the handbrake is superior Panoramic sunroof is lovely if you want speed, style, stability all in one go for jeep compass limited plus 4*4
It is an amazing car, perfect for Indian roads. Features of the car are amazing. Design, premium luxury, good making, safety, good mileage, 4Ã—4 power, good feel of an off-road drive, very strong body. This car is suitable for all age person, good handling for girls, good seats, amazing leg space, amazing light design, good small works. 
The buying experience wasn't as expected. The car, however, was a different story. It has the looks which draw passerby's attention, very fun to drive due to the amount of power and torque available on hand. The build quality is commendable (both exterior and interior), far better than cars in the same segment. The numerous small features give a good feel. It gives around 12kmpl for daily city driving which is acceptable. The after sales service is a bit on the higher side and they don't provide free pick up and drop for the same, which all manufacturers do. Also, it hurts more as there are only two service outlets in Delhi and that too at different corners. Best car in its segment though.
Awesome car. Best SUV to drive in the price range. Built quality is very solid and a quick peppy engine.
A beautiful machine to drive in. With power and smooth engine, you don't feel like getting out of the car.
I was impressed with the design. Still have a dream, that one day I will be the owner of this muscle.
Jeep compass limited plus is a very nice SUV. It looks like a muscular and top class car. The car's make and build quality is fantastic, you feel better during offroad. There are 50+ safety features in this car. There is a new feature of a panoramic sunroof, looks amazing. Car parking button is good.
Best car for Indian roads solid build and strong looks comprehends together to make the machine irresistible to watch, drive quality above any other in this price range. Happy to be an owner of the Jeep Compass. feeling proud of my choice. 
Jeep Compass is a good car I am using this car Car very smooth I am very happy to brand sound too good and seat memories are awesome Jeep compass sunroof very large panoramic sunroof is too good.
One of the wonderful car for a family. it is suitable for all kind of roads.milage is perfect for highways.simble of jeep very luxurious in the world. This car is a budget car for all middle-class people. In the car sound system is very perfect. The luxurious look is the greatest things in the car. Seats in the car is very suitable for my family
Ultimate design , ultimate feature, comfortable seats and price
I am using sport Bedrock petrol and it is felt that there is a serious lack of power thrust especially when you get a little rise on the road (going up from downside of the road). Also, Mileage I am getting in the city is around 8 KM/ L which is very poor compared to any other vehicle in this segment.
Superb SUV. Its top 4Ã—4 model is very cool. Its features are the best features among all the SUV's which I have reviewed. And its look is very perfect. Its colour combination is very good.
Awesome car. When we talk about the features so it has awesome features.
Best for off-road and adventure and exploring new destinations.
It comes with great driving experience and with power, build quality of this car is best in its segment.
The car is feature loaded and comes with 2.0 litres turbocharged engine which gives you the power to ride. The suspension is best in class. Interior is awesome and the comfort level is up high. A real value for money car. The best thing is jeep has designed the car for India terrains. A very powerful and luxurious machine built to please the rider. I m a happy owner of the Jeep.
One of the finest SUVs that came across as searching for the right one. This one is a head turner and the performance is just amazing. Once u drive it, it's just you and the machine, just wonderful, loved the beast.
The ride quality and driving dynamics of the car makes this SUV feel like a sports hatch. Haven't had so much fun driving an SUV. The last time I had so much fun was in a first generation swift. The vehicle feels really planted and stable at triple-digit speeds on the highway. The fit and finish quality are excellent. The leather seats are one of the best in the segment but the white interior is difficult to maintain. What didn't work for me are Rear seat comfort- the rear seat is too upright and doesn't have a reclining option even in the top end variant. No Automatic in the diesel top end- though the vehicle has a fantastic engine and the gearbox is better suited for highway driving. In the city traffic, you will have to be shifting down a lot. The indicator and wiper position: This might not be an actual flaw for many but it is still an ergonomic flaw in the Indian driving conditions. For a vehicle that needs a constant changing of gears in the traffic the indicator being on the left of the steering is an inconvenience. Verdict: This would be a perfect sports SUV best suited for a younger audience and would be an excellent alternative to a mini countryman if you are not looking for an automatic. 
Best SUV in the segment! I'm in love with Jeep. It's really a head turner vehicle! Great Road appearance.
I will only say some words because there is nothing to say about the car. It's awesome we brought the car at 2018 July. It has six gear also 17tn 17+ average there service is also good the people are awesome. I will tell you that we were going to buy the Baleno.
Bought the Jeep Compass sport in august 2018. From Khatwani motors, Jabalpur. It is more of an SUV than a soft-roader. It has patchy dynamics but is a well-finished model with good off-road capabilities. The 4x2 mode has a good off road capabilities. Whereas the 4x4 has excellent off-road capabilities. The departure angle is excellent. The only issue is with the mileage. It does not give the promised average of 14km/l. It only gives around 10km/l on highway and around 6 km/ l in the city depending on the traffic. * Has a noisy engine which is the only disadvantage after mileage. The well-tied suspension, as well as cleverly distributed torque through the 4WD system, does make this is perfectly capable thing through corners, even ones with lots of crests and dips. The touch-screen is easy to navigate. The Apple CarPlay/Android Auto integration is pretty tight too. Just near the USB port is a handy mesh pocket to hold your phone. Overall I would like to give it 8 stars out of 10. It's an excellent SUV. I love to own an American ðŸš™
It's a great car. I have a Jeep Compass 2018 is a limited manual car. It was my dream to own. Till date, I haven't faced any problem. The power, handling, luxury feel, everything you get it for 20-25 lakhs is absolutely insane. More than that it's really suited to Indian road conditions. I never felt lethargic even after driving for 600+ km per day.

But not Battery Not sure what more is not under warranty Average 9 km per liter of Petrol is a disaster as against 12 told while selling While buying the Showroom insurance rep asked me. 90000 plus, when I insisted on getting from outside, they dropped to. 58000 They charged me. 30000 for Nano paint and some not so useful or rather useless stuff as a package I'm not sure this vehicle will last for 5 years as against my Toyota Corolla which ran for 12 Year with not this kind of Drama and wrong commits Careful before you decide.
 Jeep Compass SUV is awesome, the comfort, driving pleasure, off-roading capabilities are top notch, no comparison of this SUV in this segment.
Hi I purchased Jeep Compass last year in July still 1year is not completed yet, and the car is creating so many problems in engine side like fuel pump failed and no parts available at service agency in Hyderabad. I suggest everyone not to buy Jeep Compass.
I am a pride owner of Jeep Compass limited plus 4x2. Buying this car is a good decision. I am glad about the performance of this car. I would surely recommend it. And if anyone is thinking to buy it go for it. Don't think of any harrier or hector. Compass is famous for its premium quality.
Initially, I was a bit hesitant about Jeep Compass, but after months of usage, it feels great to own such a machine. High in power and styling, pure driving pleasure. Bit expensive but justified after checking competitors in the market.
BUYING OF JEEP COMPASS IS A GOOD DECISION. JEEP IS POWERFUL, NICE ON HIGHWAYS BUT BRAKING IS SUDDEN AND DRIVING IN CITY TRAFFIC IS NOT EASY. MY PETROL JEEP IS GIVING MILEAGE OF 10 KM/LTR INSTEAD OF 16 KM/LTR WHICH NEEDS TO BE CHECKED AND I MADE COMPLAINT AT SERVICE CENTER BUT NO SATISFACTORY REPLY / ACTION. AFTER SALES SERVICE IS GOOD EXCEPT MILEAGE PROBLEM.
Jeep Compass is an ultimate SUV. Totally satisfied with my licence to off-road. The only drawback is less backspace. Unmatched power.
I just owned Jeep Compass, and I loved it. It's not a car but its the best option in this price range.
The darling car of my life. Great to have such a wonderful car drive feature and beauty is excellent.
My dream car The best of look and ahead of all cars Its stunning look is attractive and a lot...
Bought the Jeep Compass sport in august 2018. From Khatwani motors, Jabalpur. It is more of an SUV than a soft-roader. It has patchy dynamics but is a well-finished model with good off-road capabilities. The 4x2 mode has a good off road capabilities. Whereas the 4x4 has excellent off-road capabilities. The departure angle is excellent. The only issue is with the mileage. It does not give the promised average of 14km/l. It only gives around 10km/l on highway and around 6 km/ l in the city depending on the traffic. * Has a noisy engine which is the only disadvantage after mileage. The well-tied suspension, as well as cleverly distributed torque through the 4WD system, does make this is perfectly capable thing through corners, even ones with lots of crests and dips. The touch-screen is easy to navigate. The Apple CarPlay/Android Auto integration is pretty tight too. Just near the USB port is a handy mesh pocket to hold your phone. Overall I would like to give it 8 stars out of 10. It's an excellent SUV. I love to own an American ðŸš™
It's a great car. I have a Jeep Compass 2018 is a limited manual car. It was my dream to own. Till date, I haven't faced any problem. The power, handling, luxury feel, everything you get it for 20-25 lakhs is absolutely insane. More than that it's really suited to Indian road conditions. I never felt lethargic even after driving for 600+ km per day.
Jeep Compass is the most efficient car, elegantly designed, and most powerful car in this segment, compared to Harrier, Creta this is the most efficient and it's the best value for money. Excellent driving experience with all the necessary features required in this segment of car. If any confusion with similar cars, just go and get jeep compass blindly and buy. Its limited plus version it's the best value for money.
Too many issues with the clutch plates and 2.0 liters Fiat-sourced diesel engine is problematic and compelled me to get the clutch plates changed twice in just 4000kms.
Its been nearly 2 years of my Jeep Compass limited edition and I must say, it's just a completely fantastic car. The features are very good. Loved this car and its value for money. Maintenance is a bit high but the person who buys 5 seaters in this range does not feel it so.
Jeep Compass is a nice car loaded with more features cost is less, the interior looks very nice. Suitable in price best off-roading car, compact SUV, the car of the year, all segments colours looking very nice, engine very nice ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ , more powerful car, it is an also adventure car for off-roading, teren management system is very good.
I purchased Jeep Compass Limited Plus on 1st of July 2019 and within 15 days (vehicle has not even driven 500km out of which 300km on first day) lot of annoying sounds audible from the sunroof, dashboard, doors (maybe from C-pillar) and now from suspension. 
Jeep Compass is a great car because the dimensions of the car look brilliant and the pick-up of the car is tremendous.
The car has very high service costs and also requires regular service. It costs me 2 lacs plus in last 12 months. I would not suggest buying this as this cost is not justified with the performance of the car. Complaints are not monitored by the company. They really don't care for your concern.
Jeep Compass is a most likely car I drown till know. It is superb I mostly like is comfort I was driving to Kerala from my place I had not to feel tired at all.
Jeep Compass is an excellent SUV which scores on safety features and excellent all-round performance. Jeep Compass is an excellent highway cruiser. Jeep Compass comes with safety features such as traction control, rollover mitigation, ESP, Electronic Parking Brake, Hill Assist, Hill Descent Control as standard. Jeep compass build quality, interior design, and quality are top-notch. There are some pros and cons of Compass as follows:- PROS 1. Class-leading off-roading capabilities. 2. The diesel engine is extremely frugal and responsive. 4. Dominant seven-slat grille, the sharp proportions, and the rectangular arches have succeeded in catching the attention of many Indians. There are a lot of Compass customers in India who praise its design more than anything. 5. 6 Speed Manual Gearbox is very smooth. 6. Owing to off-road character, compass gets four driving modes in its Selec- Terrain all-wheel-drive system such as Auto, Snow, Sand, and Mud- the systems adjust the engine mapping and traction control to move easily over the selected terrain. 7. The individual Suspension set up of the jeep compass further increases its off-road capability. 8. Plastic quality and materials used on the compass are extremely superb and best in class. CONS 1. Missing some features. 2. Poor rear seat comfort feels claustrophobic and not good for three adults. 3. Too much expensive. 4. 7-speed DCT Automatic gearbox is not very smooth, quickest and lacks punch. 5. The petrol engine is noisy than other rivals such as Creta and hector. 6. The brakes are good, but while slowing down from high speeds it seems to lack the necessary bite for sharp and effective braking.
Jeep Compass is a very good car. It is an SUV under 20lacs. It has a touch screen infotainment system, legroom is also very good. It gives a luxurious look. The AC provides cooling very fast. Connectivity is also good. 5 people can be seated easily. I have Grey colour of it. It also has led DRLs. Boot space is also very spacious. Ground Clearance is also better. It feels nice while driving.
True to its tag line "GO ANYWHERE DO ANYTHING" Jeep Compass is the Best SUV in its segment. Super build quality and above all it provides the best driving pleasure. #jeeplife.
Beast in hand, the word for this is a perfect car, It can ruin any car on road weather its highway or city driving, the car is unmatched, using from last one month and every day is like the first day. Now the drawback time, bad fuel efficiency 7-8 KMPL, and the major drawback is initial power lag that will always surprise you. I have to go as per car demands not as you like, but a benefit is a manual option. I am enjoying my car like anything, after initial power lag that car become beast.
With a striking interior and exterior design, host of feel-good features and multiple powertrain options, jeep seems to have cut no corners in equipping its first offering for India.
I am not complaining for Jeep Compass but my reason for 4 stars is that of its pricing and maintenance. In the top model budget one can own a big car like Fortuner. Overall it is a good package but somewhere it has been differentiated from its own segment cars Just a status maintaining product but a good car .
I purchased the Jeep Compass limited plus model in May 2019. I drove this vehicle 7000 km only and it started creating problems like leaked diesel pump, engine problem such a 3rd class car it is.
The car has an awesome pick-up and comes with a marvelous look. It has full filled all my requirements, I love to drive this car especially off-roading and in hilly areas.
Jeep Compass - Premium is the other word for it. A comfortable and porch car. Thank you jeep.
Super nice look and interior also good.
The car is under a 3 year Warranty. But not Battery Not sure what more is not under warranty Average 9 km per liter of Petrol is a disaster as against 12 told while selling While buying the Showroom insurance rep asked me. 90000 plus, when I insisted on getting from outside, they dropped to. 58000 They charged me. 30000 for Nano paint and some not so useful or rather useless stuff as a package I'm not sure this vehicle will last for 5 years as against my Toyota Corolla which ran for 12 Year with not this kind of Drama and wrong commits Careful before you decide.

My dream car The best of look and ahead of all cars Its stunning look is attractive and a lot...
I had planned a road trip with some of my friends last week. I have an MG Hector Sharp Hybrid 1.5. Drove the car from Raipur to Jagdalpur without stopping anywhere, that's approximately 300Kms. The mileage was 13.5 kmpl. We stopped for an hour and continued our trip to Danteshwari, then to Chitrakoot waterfalls, then back to Jagdalpur, then we returned to Raipur. This was all within 36 hours. The car nearly had a continuous run. There were all types of terrains enough from single lane steep hilly terrain to no roads at all in the Bastar region, roads filled with potholes were also on our list, and the car handled everything pretty well. At the end of the trip, the car travelled over 1200Kms and to my surprise, the engine temperature was optimal all the way even after rash driving on a long stretch of roads(State Highway), speeds exceeding 150Kmph, the overall mileage at the end of the trip was 12.6KmpL. This car performed well beyond my expectations. As I even drove it over 350kms on a single stretch and still faced no problems, no fatigue. Quite refined engine there MG.
I personally use this car and think it is a good car and a comfortable car. So I would like to recommend this car to all. Please, go to your near MG showroom and buy one for yourself. I'm a businessman so I have to travel a lot but in comfort. So, because of this, I bought the new MG Hector.
One of the expensive cars, I really love this car is fully automatic. My favorite car is MG Hector this car performance is very good I cannot explain this car because this car is cool I am buying this car previous year my car colour is white and he was looking awesome this is a fantastic car and good.
I was waiting to get this car in Coimbatore, at last, I went to Chennai and got it is really wonderful. I request everyone to get MG Hector I heard that the branch has been open in Coimbatore, before I had XUV car but MG Hector is a very good experience, so once if you try this car you will not get any other car I Love MG Hector.
MG Hector is the best car, and the best intelligence technologies have used in this car. The brand has launched a very best car in this segment. Also, this car has very good torque and futuristic feature in an affordable price range. This car should get the best car award.
I bought sharp at diesel and it is very satisfying to buy this car right now or you will regret it buy it now mg Hector is a nice car and it is the only car that is bigger than Audi q5 You should buy it and even lower models are very satisfying. I have an Audi a4 30tfsi 2017 model And it is smaller than MG Hector top model.
Amazing piece of a machine, superb control & handling, gadget freak car, loaded with maximum features.
I love this car. This car is mindblowing. I like the features of this car.
Excellent car at a low price, it also has many features. It is for everyone who will buy this car and enjoy the trips and long June.
MG Hector is a budget-friendly car, Very wide range of functions and nice experience with Voice Commands. Hoping for the best advancement in this brand with respect to time.
One of my family friends has been using this car for 2 months. We have gone for a trip to Belgaum using this car after he bought it. In my opinion, this is the best car suitable for Indian roads and one of the best SUV'S I have ever driven. Its features are awesome and some of its possibilities of headrest, device connectivity is very good. Good ground clearance, mileage is also effective.
Excellent car with tech-packed, a good car for the Indian market and attraction grabbing exterior and interior.
Good mg assistant, nice gear quality, comfortable seats, nice sky roof, big space for the bottle and another thing, and the look is awesome.
Starting with the most impressive powertrain in the MG Hector, the petrol hybrid. Despite its capacity, the motor shows a likable eagerness to build speed. It's a torquey engine and doesn't seem underpowered even if you stick it in a higher gear than necessary.
When we first experienced the Hector on the hills of Coimbatore, we knew it had the makings of a winner. No doubt, the distinctive design, exhaustive features list and a hugely spacious cabin are all strong factors in the success of an SUV, but that brief drive was just a sampler and didn't include the petrol-automatic variant. This variant is the pick of the lot, accounting for over 50 percent sales, and has a waiting period that can stretch to seven months. Hence, in this very exacting road test. The other big talking point is the connectivity you get from a dedicated SIM card that's embedded in the infotainment system. This allows your phone to communicate with MG's iSMART app, which gives you control of a host of functions remotely. The app, available on both Apple and Android platforms, lets you set driver alerts, check the overall health of the car, and find your car in a parking spot by flashing the headlights and activating the horn. If you've parked far off, the app will also guide you to your spot by mapping the route. Then there is the geofencing functionality, which means you can set a perimeter (of up to 100km) for your Hector, and should it go beyond that, it would send you alerts on your smartphone. It also tells you the driving style, speed, and alerts medical services and preset contacts in the unfortunate event of an accident where airbags have been deployed.
It has more and good features in comparison to other cars in this range. MG hector is capable to stand in front of BMW, MERCEDES, etc.
The MG Hector wow what a car, almost all features under one roof that's how we welcome the technology in 2019 I believe the build body of the car, as well as the interiors, are speechless, Of course, the price range I guess no car company or segment is offering all those features which are in Hector.
The infotainment system is great and is a big size SUV. This feature-loaded car is giving competition to other cars.
An extremely comfortable contribution to the automobile industry with a dominant road presence and contains very strong suspension so as to give you with utmost comfort irrespective of the length and breadth of the journey.
It is a complete car with all new facilities, MG Hector's body is very good and its performance is excellent. It is very advance according to the era. It has very good features inside it which are not above the other car in this range moreover its price is right.

Mg hector is best for official use and it was an amazing car. It can be told to be the richest look of this car. It was not a costly car with this type of feature. I am very helpful to mg motors for this type and featured car launched in India. So that model was a very easy affordable piece for peoples so it can be the best car in India.
Good looks, high-performance level. Highly recommended! This new company in India is changing the game and introducing some fine machines with strong performance and at a reasonable price.
Best of the class. I cannot demand anything more than this at such a price. The engine is a beast, the interior is amazing.
India's first internet car with good features, it's a dream come true for all Indians in this price segment.
I could never imagine that the petrol Hybrid engine can churn this much power. The 1.5L engine gives an amazing power in the mid-range up to 2000RPM. It has 6 airbags, ABS, TC hill hold, etc. It's quite comfortable and the rear seating is very much comfortable. The infotainment system is of superb quality as it has a 10.4-inch huge touch screen.
It's a powerful XUV with all comfort and ensuring driving and travel experience MG its an experience of a technological and powerful shift in XUV series. Also, luxurious interior and have a very torque powerful engine.
Great car in the budget segment. Very comfortable for driver and for everyone inside. Futuristic design and features.
MG Hector is a good and perfect sporty car. Really its a proud to be own this legend. Front of this car is really looking like cars in the UAE, Saudi Arabia, etc.
MG Hector is a best car with all the required features. It is very comfortable to drive in the village areas as well. Best family car.  
Best features in this segment. Filled with technology. The best price range for the specifications they are providing. This car is something Out of the box in the Indian Market. As this car is the first impression of MG motors in the Indian market they have worked a lot on this. The sunroof which is there is usually in Jaguar or BMW.
It is a good car but as compared to the Harrier, it is not good but is better in features. Safety should be ensured by checking all updates to be done in the car because the safety should be more and should be 5 stars in the NCAP test by beating the Nexon so that it will be the safest car of 2020.
It is a great car with good new features. Spacious and well equipped, new locking system with smart airbags. After the first service from Chandigarh, it is much smooth
MG Hector is a superb vehicle and totally feature-loaded, value for money and some minor aroused exterior like small tire size for a big vehicle, and rear side would be over reflector presence.
Very good vehicle but I look any more vehicles what is MG hectare is a good vehicle the interior nice space looking so nice and very good price Maruti Suzuki Baleno price MG hectare is a very good road trip vehicle this is not compared with you any more vehicle but I will be told very good vehicle nice looking.
Yesterday I drove this car from one of my friends. I think this is a very luxurious car nowadays with super-awesome features.
Great car with great interiors and equipped with the latest features.
It is so amazing and it so much easy for me to drive.
Good looking. Amazing performance what a style. The brand is making perfect for youngsters. Important for safety as well.
A wonderful and an amazing car. High ranking car of the year with all facilities like air bags, A.C., and much more.
That's the special car of the year. I experienced there is one of the luxurious low budget SUV I have seen.
The car is beyond the next level. The function like "hey MG" is the best feature it has. Amazing speed and wonderful performance it has.
I bought MG Hector in October and so far this car gave me good mileage and very nice driving experience. Its infotainment system with the internet inside is a futuristic feature. Nice and spacious car with so many features and good mileage too. Value for money.
This car is just awesome, because of the design, the internet inside and the looks of this car and the engine performance is really good.
MG Hector is the best car one can buy. Its comfort and class are uncomparable. Just an amazing vehicle one can buy. Safety features in hector are best in segment . you can always believe in the name MG because it defines comfort, class, safety. 
Best car for the family.
Super good car and excellent condition with great mileage. Good interiors, wonderful performance and best designed.
I like this car very much because of its spacious cabin and legroom for the passenger side and the internet inside the car is very much fast. Its engine fuel efficiency is good. Its interior is full of new features and it is also available in different colors and different variants.
The car is amazing, just mind-boggling features it has. I don't have words for it as the build quality is amazing.
A very interesting and spectacular car. MG Hector is world famous now. The huge sunroof and the big 10-inch screen makes this car spectacular. This car gives very good comfort and large boot space. The entertainment in this is the most spectacular feature in MG Hector.
People might like the Kia better but this car has its class of its own with its phenomenal looks and stance which is a charmer on road. The features too are fully loaded as one would expect it to be so good job by the MG team.
1. The exterior looks superb and is a perfect car for men. 2. Best car in this class in the price. 3. Luxurious seating. 4. Large Panorama window. 5. Larger boot space. 6. Only a few commands are working. 7. Pickup, when compared to the same segment bit, lags in this and not that comfortable for driving, and especially due to a short clutch. 9. The body is super.  10. After-sales service package was awesome never heard these kinds of offers.
The MG Hector pretty much outsizes everything in its class. Its length and wheelbase are the largest amongst its rivals, though the narrow girth and excessive rear overhang do throw proportions off a bit. Generous use of chrome means the Hector is big on bling and elements like the split LED DRLs and headlamps set up ensure the MG grabs attention.
Good and excellent car and it takes all the attention of all the other cars just due to it's exterior. Good in all aspects.
Smooth feel inside the beast. An amazing car so far.
A real slayer. The interior and the exteriors are so dashing. Far better than Toyota Fortuner.
The most powerful car.
Perfect drive due to ultimate steering and infotainment system is mind-blowing.
Amazing drive and great looks.

By looking at the specifications and features, MG Hector seems to be a strong contender in its segment. It excels in every department be it engine, features, design, space. It comes with many segment-first features like an internet-based vertically mounted 10.4 inches infotainment system, a full panoramic sunroof, connected car features, etc that make it more appealing to the Indian consumer. Apart from features, MG Hector is also very well equipped in terms of safety. Safety features like dual front airbags, ABS with EBD, ESP, traction control, all four disc brakes, hill hold assist, and ISOFIX child seat mounts are stand across the range. Only if MG can price the Hector aggressively, somewhere between 15-20 Lakh then I think it will be a value for money option for buyers in the segment. As MG is a new brand in the Indian automotive market, it will be interesting to see how MG handles the sale and service of its vehicles. To me, MG Hector seems to be a solid competitor to other vehicles in its segment. It seems to be a sensible choice for someone who is looking to buy a well built and feature-rich SUV under 20 Lakhs. Only time will tell how well the MG brand performs in the Indian automotive market.
Superb looking marvelous beauty with a beast Engine. Will rock Indian car market. Extraordinary features that surprise. Beautiful Front design with superb headlight. Rear design is really Sex and great. Panoramic Sunroof looks deadly in the pictures, I'm definitely sure it will be a breath shocking the moment I get to see the car with my eyes. Interior are excellent.if prices would be kept in competitive range. This car would rule the sun segment. Congrats to MG Hector team. Great work done. Welcome to India and wish all the best.
MG Hector is a wonderful car in this model. Also in this price range getting a good option. The tail lights are the luxurious look and the additional sunroof is providing the energy to interior spaces of car. The diesel engine is providing extreme performance to the car like a beast. It would be my dream car.
I had a chance to look at this car in the UK and trust me it?s nothing more than a Chinese car with British badge. From the side, it looks very odd and out of shape especially with its tyres which looks disproportionate. It actually looks like an ugly brother of MPV fused with SUV when seen in person. Spending around 15-20 lakhs for a Chinese car with no proven credentials is not something I am keen on.
It has Good Safety features. E connect is definitely a USP for this car. It will redefine the SUV segment for Indians. The MG Hector comes with lots of features which are 1st in the SUV segment. MG Hector is able to get a lot of attention due to its innovative features. This SUV definitely looks value for money.
In this price MG Hector is wonderful, features are excellent, hill hold, 360-degree camera view sunroof and many more it would be my dream car.
Best car for young gears. It's look is awesome, also feature are great.

Exterior, as well as interior, is so attractive in this segment with the affordable price. An SUV with features and abilities that make it more than just a car. Inside the tough frame and behind the assertive front, sits a heart that makes Hector a car you can connect with. The 10.4 inches, vertically mounted Full HD touch screen display Head Unit is the command center of the car.

MG Hector will be the best car in future and at the cheapest price ever. If you tell the voice assistant to open the door, immediately it will open the door. You can also open sunroof by Using voice assist. You can also remote control it using MG app. For example, you can slow down the AC power or you can of it. The interior and exterior are very good.
To be honest I am reviewing the first time for any car. The best thing about this car is that it is future ready. No need to get upset about technical advancement. In fact, without seeing it or driving it I am already in love with this car. The looks are so mesmerizing that now it become my dream to own this car. In one word Supreme leader in your segment.
MG Hector is a wonderful car in this model. Also in this price range getting a good option. A perfect car in terms of comfort which getting in this car. Good SUV in this range.
It's truly more than a Human Thing. It would be a trend setter for the modern SUVs and lead from the front. It's been a dream to have such a car. MG Hector is The Smartest of its segment where it shows that even machines need to be sensitive and understand the needs. Hector is sure to build relations for generations.
I like I want to buy that I like for the first time in advertisement my parents told that to by this car.

Hector is just the best .coming with such advanced techno features that no.other is offering.
Great car. We're very happy for MG  cars come in India. MG make a milestone in India.
MG hector is going to be the best car under 20lk and the best family tour car too.
I found Hector the best in the segment. I appreciate the price in this category with exclusive features. I am really eager to take test drive of Hector. I am sure the test drive will double my likes for Hector. This is the first car I have seen where I stop thinking for other cars. There is not a single doubt on the performance. Obviously test drive is the add-on feature.
A very amazing car when it comes to looks both the interior and the exterior looks. This company has come out with its first car MG HECTOR in India has a variety of such features which other cars don't have Looking at all the features it is quite cheap at the price at which it is available The mileage is also good as it provides a mileage of 17-19kmpl It has a seating capacity of 5people The backspace is also very good and a good amount of baggage can be kept Has a nice music system fit In it so nice sound quality can be enjoyed The seats are also comfortable The rear windows don't open fully so that is a problem which some of us may take as Drivers system can be adjusted electronically Huge amount of lights?s available in the car.
It is a sporty car. The looks are very stylish. I am impressed with the engineering. 
excellent view of mg hector overall car designed in the way that anybody shall be like in the first view. cost of the mg hector is also companionable to other SUVs. I think the company is giving a big opportunity to the public feel luxurious in the low cost.4to5 person will easily sit with comfort n take the luxurious journey.
Best sports utility vehicle under this price segments it has an engine which is best in torque the best sound with four speakers and two twisters. This car has best safety feature such as six airbags it has electronic brake distribution and anti-lock brake distribution it has disk break on four tires of has ten inches full Hd display as a stereo system.
I found Hector to be a game changer in the Indian market in the economy SUV segment especially being the first smart car. A strong road presence and classy interiors are certainly the best compared to Jeep Compass and Harrier. Really looking forward to seeing one on the road soon.
This is the best car. The looks are amazing. 
The model details itself captured my mind. If i plan to buy a new vehicle my first preference will definitely these one itself, in no other vehicles, i have seen this many features, not only that this vehicle gives more care for safety as well. I am very excited for a great launch of my dream vehicle.
So nice Car India's First E-sim car. His Assistant is So Responsible. You should buy this Car.This car contains very good specs
Awesome car by MG, hope that they will bring better options in their next cars.
I had planned a road trip with some of my friends last week. I have an MG Hector Sharp Hybrid 1.5. Drove the car from Raipur to Jagdalpur without stopping anywhere, that's approximately 300Kms. The mileage was 13.5 kmpl. We stopped for an hour and continued our trip to Danteshwari, then to Chitrakoot waterfalls, then back to Jagdalpur, then we returned to Raipur. This was all within 36 hours. The car nearly had a continuous run. There were all types of terrains enough from single lane steep hilly terrain to no roads at all in the Bastar region, roads filled with potholes were also on our list, and the car handled everything pretty well. At the end of the trip, the car travelled over 1200Kms and to my surprise, the engine temperature was optimal all the way even after rash driving on a long stretch of roads(State Highway), speeds exceeding 150Kmph, the overall mileage at the end of the trip was 12.6KmpL. This car performed well beyond my expectations. As I even drove it over 350kms on a single stretch and still faced no problems, no fatigue. Quite refined engine there MG.
I personally use this car and think it is a good car and a comfortable car. So I would like to recommend this car to all. Please, go to your near MG showroom and buy one for yourself. I'm a businessman so I have to travel a lot but in comfort. So, because of this, I bought the new MG Hector.
One of the expensive cars, I really love this car is fully automatic. My favorite car is MG Hector this car performance is very good I cannot explain this car because this car is cool I am buying this car previous year my car colour is white and he was looking awesome this is a fantastic car and good.
I was waiting to get this car in Coimbatore, at last, I went to Chennai and got it is really wonderful. I request everyone to get MG Hector I heard that the branch has been open in Coimbatore, before I had XUV car but MG Hector is a very good experience, so once if you try this car you will not get any other car I Love MG Hector.
MG Hector is the best car, and the best intelligence technologies have used in this car. The brand has launched a very best car in this segment. Also, this car has very good torque and futuristic feature in an affordable price range. This car should get the best car award.
I bought sharp at diesel and it is very satisfying to buy this car right now or you will regret it buy it now mg Hector is a nice car and it is the only car that is bigger than Audi q5 You should buy it and even lower models are very satisfying. I have an Audi a4 30tfsi 2017 model And it is smaller than MG Hector top model.
Amazing piece of a machine, superb control & handling, gadget freak car, loaded with maximum features.
I love this car. This car is mindblowing. I like the features of this car.
Excellent car at a low price, it also has many features. It is for everyone who will buy this car and enjoy the trips and long June.
MG Hector is a budget-friendly car, Very wide range of functions and nice experience with Voice Commands. Hoping for the best advancement in this brand with respect to time.
One of my family friends has been using this car for 2 months. We have gone for a trip to Belgaum using this car after he bought it. In my opinion, this is the best car suitable for Indian roads and one of the best SUV'S I have ever driven. Its features are awesome and some of its possibilities of headrest, device connectivity is very good. Good ground clearance, mileage is also effective.
Excellent car with tech-packed, a good car for the Indian market and attraction grabbing exterior and interior.
Good mg assistant, nice gear quality, comfortable seats, nice sky roof, big space for the bottle and another thing, and the look is awesome.
Starting with the most impressive powertrain in the MG Hector, the petrol hybrid. Despite its capacity, the motor shows a likable eagerness to build speed. It's a torquey engine and doesn't seem underpowered even if you stick it in a higher gear than necessary.
When we first experienced the Hector on the hills of Coimbatore, we knew it had the makings of a winner. No doubt, the distinctive design, exhaustive features list and a hugely spacious cabin are all strong factors in the success of an SUV, but that brief drive was just a sampler and didn't include the petrol-automatic variant. This variant is the pick of the lot, accounting for over 50 percent sales, and has a waiting period that can stretch to seven months. Hence, in this very exacting road test. The other big talking point is the connectivity you get from a dedicated SIM card that's embedded in the infotainment system. This allows your phone to communicate with MG's iSMART app, which gives you control of a host of functions remotely. The app, available on both Apple and Android platforms, lets you set driver alerts, check the overall health of the car, and find your car in a parking spot by flashing the headlights and activating the horn. If you've parked far off, the app will also guide you to your spot by mapping the route. Then there is the geofencing functionality, which means you can set a perimeter (of up to 100km) for your Hector, and should it go beyond that, it would send you alerts on your smartphone. It also tells you the driving style, speed, and alerts medical services and preset contacts in the unfortunate event of an accident where airbags have been deployed.
It has more and good features in comparison to other cars in this range. MG hector is capable to stand in front of BMW, MERCEDES, etc.
The MG Hector wow what a car, almost all features under one roof that's how we welcome the technology in 2019 I believe the build body of the car, as well as the interiors, are speechless, Of course, the price range I guess no car company or segment is offering all those features which are in Hector.
The infotainment system is great and is a big size SUV. This feature-loaded car is giving competition to other cars.
An extremely comfortable contribution to the automobile industry with a dominant road presence and contains very strong suspension so as to give you with utmost comfort irrespective of the length and breadth of the journey.
It is a complete car with all new facilities, MG Hector's body is very good and its performance is excellent. It is very advance according to the era. It has very good features inside it which are not above the other car in this range moreover its price is right.

Mg hector is best for official use and it was an amazing car. It can be told to be the richest look of this car. It was not a costly car with this type of feature. I am very helpful to mg motors for this type and featured car launched in India. So that model was a very easy affordable piece for peoples so it can be the best car in India.
Good looks, high-performance level. Highly recommended! This new company in India is changing the game and introducing some fine machines with strong performance and at a reasonable price.
Best of the class. I cannot demand anything more than this at such a price. The engine is a beast, the interior is amazing.
India's first internet car with good features, it's a dream come true for all Indians in this price segment.
I could never imagine that the petrol Hybrid engine can churn this much power. The 1.5L engine gives an amazing power in the mid-range up to 2000RPM. It has 6 airbags, ABS, TC hill hold, etc. It's quite comfortable and the rear seating is very much comfortable. The infotainment system is of superb quality as it has a 10.4-inch huge touch screen.
It's a powerful XUV with all comfort and ensuring driving and travel experience MG its an experience of a technological and powerful shift in XUV series. Also, luxurious interior and have a very torque powerful engine.
Great car in the budget segment. Very comfortable for driver and for everyone inside. Futuristic design and features.
MG Hector is a good and perfect sporty car. Really its a proud to be own this legend. Front of this car is really looking like cars in the UAE, Saudi Arabia, etc.
MG Hector is a best car with all the required features. It is very comfortable to drive in the village areas as well. Best family car.

VERY WORST EXPERIENCE I HAVE, WORST MILEAGE AND NO PICKUP, 21.75 LAKH ON ROAD PRICE,WASTE OF MONEY ,BECAUSE I BOUGHT SELTOS ON BEFORE 2 MONTHS IN COIMBATORE, DEALER SAID A SO MANY FUTURES IN CAR AND U HAD BEST SUV IN BS 6 ,ALL R FAKE BECAUSE I HAD A WORST EXPERIENCE IN LONG DRIVE 13.5 KM MILEAGE IN 80KM SPEED AND BREAKING SYSTEM R VERY WORST ,SERVICE COST IS MORE THEN HIGH COMPARISON OF CRETA AND DUSTER ,SO PLEASE DONT BY A SELTOS. SERVICE RESPONSE IS VERY VERY WORST IN YOUR LIFE TIME EXPERIENCE, MY ADVICE IS DON'T BYE SELTOS GTX AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION 7 DCT PETROL
After spending 15.5 + lakhs you get basic features. HTX, HTX+ Petrol variants even do not have rear disk brakes! Only 2 airbags, no eps, no brake assist, no traction control! Wtf you get after so much just a look! They thinks Indians are cattles and they are dumb, they don't require safety? Can kia lust out details of features launched in Korea and elsewhere? People must stop buying this bullock cart!,
"I saw lots of people cribbing about how kia has come up with weak engines or price is little high.its a mid size suv.which competes with creta ,ecosport,duster.one can buy a good feature loaded car within 11 lakh.if you have budget more than that,then one can go for hector,harrier etc.as i am getting 1.5 lit petrol a one above base model within 11 lakh.its a good
 engine.5 people with all their luggage can accommodate easily.you are getting rugged looks(not like soft looking creta).what do you guys want in 10-11 lakh budget car.as i said if you have budget more than 11 lakh,then this may not be fit for you.comments likhne se pehle socha karo.11 lakh ke gaadi se fortuner ya endeavour wala tasan kyon expect karte ho."
"Messed up variant list, not offering even 4 airbags for on road price of 16 to 17 lacs is a crime.  They should remove the gimmicky  features and at least provide more than 2 airbags in HtX and HtK series. Wtff seriously KIA  !!!
And no top end for automatics...making same mistake as Hyundai , at least htx ivt should be available as a top end"
I booked the car on 29 August and was told delivery in 3 months. I wasn't convinced to buy because of 1.5 ltr engine and high price for cosmetics. But then no other option available other than creta. To my surprise even after 2.5 months, the dealer was not sure when the car will come. He asked to wait until December. Why should buy a car were waiting for 5 months and still be unsatisfied. I took the right decision to cancel. Don't book the car until 6-12 months review if you have any doubts, becoz the doubts are real for sure.
"Overpriced compared to MG Hector. Would had been a steal deal for 20.5 L on road. They stretched a over but on GTX+.Mostly, I will be cancelling my booking and going for Hector.

And Beige interiors on top end?? It's ridiculous . Expected full black experience ."
"I bought my car on 27-Aug-2019 and driven about 500Km and could not found any complain in car performance. I have an major issue with infotainment system since the day one and Kia work shop is not able to provide the resolution for the same since more than a week.
Issue Description - My infotainment system is getting powered off after some time frequently and no any button on panel is working. To turn it on i need to turned off ignition of car and start it again. 
I have complained the same to kia workshop on 31-Aug-2019 and they called me thrice at their work shop and could not able to fix it. It is very inconvenient while travelling on road and my infotainment gets switched off and i need stop my car on side and restart it again.

Because of above issue my reverse camera display got switched off in between while parking and my cars bumper got scratches."
"Kia seltos is no doubt a very good car in its segment but is it really worth that price? 
Has it priced it logically in a weak automobile market ? Is it worth paying premium for BS 6 diesel engines well before rules come in ?
Why not buy other cars with best service network and great deals which will be more sweeter with GST cuts in few weeks ?

Kia has opened pre bookings very early to see the demand. And seeing Indian customers' interest in seltos, it has priced the base (useless) variant below 10 lakhs to fool us. And other variants (which are worth buying) are priced high. If you look at pricing, base petrol and diesel variant differ by 30k only but all other variants have price difference of 1-1.2 lakhs. Few more fooling techniques adopted by kia :
They created HT and GT lines to confuse customers and force us to buy costly variants.
Top HTX plus doesnt get even safety features of GTX plus, leave alone few fancy features.
AT is priced 1 lakh more than its respective variant, but no safety features are given as bonus (other car makers do that).
DCT technology is new and it is tried on us , that too with premium pricing.
Top variants of diesel AT and petrol DCT are priced same and also the base diesel and petrol MT are closely priced, but in between they are
differing by 1-1.2 lakhs. 

Summary is that we all are at fault, since we have shown interest in seltos well before launch and pre-booked in large numbers. This has given kia (the new entrant) the confidence to price their models on higher side , even when automobile industry is facing biggest slump. Once crazy emotions come down for Indian customers, reality will sink in their minds and people will analyse closely the premium they are paying unnecessarily. 
It is not any hot cake that will be unavailable if you don't rush and buy now.

Otherwise how dare a new comer company shall take Indian customers for ride and happily cashing in on their confusion, when all other car makers are reeling under pressure of slowdown. 
I have also booked this car, but I am not convinced to buy and take delivery for this same reason. HTX plus AT is wrongly over priced and it is same with few more variants. Why pay so much premium for untested car and company in a discounted market. This is my personal view.

Pls comment on my review and suggest if my analysis is correct and is it worth waiting."
I visited kia motors nasik on 25 august. I m very igar to see seltos, but unfortunately show not open, i wait for  1/2 hour, then 11am. I enter in show room.  Car is superb. But salesman not notice me. I call them 2/3 times, but not interested to entertain me. Not give any details, very unprofessional  behaviear, very disapointed with atittude of person of showroom and height, not even ask for test drive, i ask for quotation but it also not available, i suggest kia, improve service,
"The Kia Seltos HTK+ model is the best value for money car in the tech line section. It has a 1.5 petrol engine which provides a very good drive experience. 
Buying experience-
The staff is really friendly and will show you every single feature of all the models before letting you decide which model you want to buy. The car took 1 month to reach me but it was worth the wait.
Riding experience- 
The ride experience was really nice. I bought the petrol variant. The mileage is really good. In the city it is around 14-16. I haven't tested in on the highway yet. The car xan go really fast but you may wanna slow down a little bit while taking turns because you may notice a little bit of traction.
Looks-
The car looks very up market, both internally and externally. It is loaded with awesome features.
Servicing-
Since i've bought it just recently i haven't done my servicing yet.
Overall the car is very good and i love the experience. In my opinion, one should buy the kia seltos rather than going for other options in this price range."
Seems like very good car..I wanted to buy HTK 1.5 petrol version. They don't have test drive for this version or any version with same petrol engine. I got diesel version test drive instead which has all together different engine specs. Dealer (Vadodara city in Gujarat)  mentioned Kia is not giving test drive for 1.5 petrol engine. How can i purchase newly launched car without test drive?
We purchased Kia seltos yesterday. Remote control not working properly. Accational it works. We showed to mysore road showroom, they could not fix it today.  They told we need to update  software and thier people are coming from factory tomorrow. How for they will fix it's big question.
"This is actually the best offering in the current price range.
People have been cribbing about features, well then pay for it! You forget it's technically not an Indian company, so taxes are more! 
The range topping GTX+ model which now also comes in both Petrol AND Diesel, comes with features that none of the vehicles in the current market offer. 6 Airbags are standard in the GTX+ models. As is ABS and EBD!
The suspension might not be as good as the Harrier's, but then you forget that has the suspension from the Range Rover Discovery. So in-short, this is actually the best suspension in the mid-size SUV segment.
At ?20.5 lacs (on-road TN) for the ranging topping editions, this automobile is pretty much the best that you can get.
Servicing, might be an issue for now. But if Hyundai is  able to provide support in any way, I believe KIA will never let us down in that regard either.
The end result is that KIA was able to bring in a very trendy and highly-equipped package into the Indian market, and at a very good time too!"
"it so comfortable and it is feature loaded along with a sunroof also with comfortable automatic nice CAR we will rate it 5 stars. 
My absolutely favourite and loved the test drive experience for the car. 
The ride felt solid and well in control at both slow and high speed as well."
"Had test-driven the petrol CVT version. The exterior looks and the interior quality is definitely worth talking about!
Great looks, sleek yet bold. Interiors are up there with the likes of expensive cars.
But alas that's all the good I can say. 

I had a lot expectations from Kia on this but turned out to a be a big disappointment. The 1.5 engine mated to the CVT gearbox is not fun to drive at all. Doesn't justify the steep pricing as well. Extremely underpowered. Haven't driven the version with the DCT. 
Suspension on low speeds are ok but the higher you go, you can feel the bumps in the car. 

Not sure of it's SUV capacity, but I am not sure it may live up to enthusiasts.

Ingress and egress was surprisingly not good in my experience, I am 6'2 for reference.

Not very good first impressions."
Excellent driving with fully loaded feature...htk+ petrol is value for money variant....better than present creta and also bigger and wider than upcoming creta .... go for it guys and I m getting 13 avg in Delhi city traffic before my 1st service. I have driven around 500 km in last 10 days....thank u kia...CHEERS
"I had taken test drive Three Times to convince myself to take delivery of the GTX Plus AT , which I booked pre-launch.

Unfortunately, more I drived, more dissatisfied from all angles.

Cost is too High - Top Model 20.50 lakhs.     Fuel average not more than 9 or 10 KMPH when I reset to Zero and tested myself.  Seating in both rows is very uncomfortable. 

Navigation is very confusing.  HUD is distracting during driving.  Sun-Roof is First Manual opening & then Electric .   Diffrent drive mode could not be tested during test drive, so not sure about their performance.

Test vehicle Tyre pressure shows 47: 45:41: 46. Sales man told that they will get adjusted in Workshop. As its a wrong measurements.

Its a complete waste of money and will be proven a complete failure vehicle. Adding 1.5 lakhs, I will go for CIVIC which is a luxurious and full comfort car in but that too when will be available in BS-VI engine only."
I have top-end petrol automatic version. This car checked all the boxes for a daily city commute. (I have bigger German SUV to take it for any occasion). I love the air filter, wire-less mobile charger and the cameras most.
"Build quality is top class compared to other cars in the segment and safety features are top-notch.
Paint quite is nice this thing will no reviewer shows..
The engine is so refined in diesel.
Slightly stiff suspension.
Rear ac vents are not effective..
Mismanagement on dealerships.
No auto-dimming orvm.
Fixed headrest for rear seats."
The car is undoubtedly the best in SUV segment. I have driven Creta & MG Hector both when I wanted to buy a SUV. Seltos is far ahead of Creta and marginally ahead of MG Hector. People had no option and they had to go for Creta (Majburi). Creta was a majburi for people looking for SUV. People who own Creta very well know that KIa Seltos is far ahead of them.  I think Kia Seltos gives the best drive experience, Comfort, safety, features and very refined petrol engine. I am seeing many people commenting about airbags & safety. No car in the range of 12-14 lakhs offer 6 airbags.
"4.servicing
I bought a new KIA seltos. But in new car hearing many noises in the car. In Ludhiana Punjab, no one can hear my problem. I m fed up with my car. Please buy your own risk. Don't buy this. 
It's my big mistake to buy this car"
Car is very good but Customer care service is very very poor. Even after 1 week of purchase, UVO app could not be activated in my mobile. Called customer care twice but could not be solved. Sent an email but they did not give any acknowledgement for the mail even after 4 days. If customer care is not able to provide support to only 15000 sold units,  how they will be able to support in future when a large number of cars will be sold.
"Top model is very costly .is 15+ lacs. So for 15+ budget I go fo MG Hector. 
Nodought car looking is very good. Interior and exterior is very good.
At least 4air bag should be compulsory in each model."
After paying almost 17 to 18 lakhs all you get is dual air airbags abs and ebd ...it should be 6 airbags... brake assist..esp ....hill start assist.... traction control. This features we get Ford EcoSport which is much cheaper compared to seltos.
suspension of the car is very soft tuned. if 3persons sits on the rear side with no luggage in boot ground clearance of car reduces from 190 mm to 150 mm. Gap bet.clading and tyre disappears.
"I had booked the HTK plus automatic diesel, the car looks good from inside and outside but when I took the test drive it was very underpowered car 1.5  with 115 bhp is very less for a car of this size, no punch in the engine.
Please don't go on the looks, I feel the car is not up to date in terms of safety & the gearbox is also very slow to respond, 0 to 100 takes 12 seconds"
I've done pre-booking on 1st day of bookings opened i.e. 16th July, 2019 at Noida dealer, my booking s.no. was 157, but neither dealer nor KIA motors could inform me of the delivery date even after 3 months of booking, when I finally cancelled my booking, after getting disappointed. There's no transparency being adhered to for delivery of cars, don't know who is at fault; dealers or KIA Motors.
High price in all diesel models compare to petrol versions for same features i don't understand why kia charging extra money for same features in diesel variants car looks are awesome but price always matter i hope they fix this problem soon as possible. I am also excited for the car but extra  price for same features stopping me to buy kia seltos. I hope they will fix the problem soon to get customers.
I don't understand that why Kia not offering safety features in this variant like 6 airbags and other features very disappointed Then what is the benefit of taking the top end variant of diesel Why is the GT line being given so much importance, Should have given all the features with the diesel version too I hope Kia is noticed
This car is so amazing the looks are extravagant.., I just book this car and I m waiting eagerly for its delivery...The front end of the Seltos is particularly impressiveÂ â€“ the huge â€˜Tiger Noseâ€™ grille is Kiaâ€™s design trademark. The entry-level engine will be a 1.5-litre naturally aspirated petrol engine, producing 113bhp and 144Nm,Â The quality levels of the Seltos â€“ of both versions of the car that we tested â€“ are simply phenomenal. From plastics and soft-touch surfaces to digital screens and general fit-and-finish, everything is simply class-leading.
First of all, I would like to confess that I am very obsessed with my car. I was very nervous while buying this car as Kia was launching its first vehicle in India. I took a test drive for at least seven to eight times before I made my decision to finally buy this. When I took the first test drive I was blown away when I listened to the audio quality of bose speakers. It was an amazing experience it was like I was in a live concert on the front sofa. The driving quality was also awesome. It runs like butter. Build quality could have been better. I strongly recommend this beast to anyone who really wants to enjoy driving with great entertainment.
"Worst  car no performance.its just for look 
My previous car was s-cross i tought Kia(seltos) will perform very well when compare with s- cross. Even I used shift  also
Compare with those cars  SELTOS is worst"
Too many variants to choose. Ultimate strategy is to push custimers for top spec variants . Cheap strategy from the company. The price should be less compared to its compitetors when it is locally manufactured, they missed that one. MG hector is best when compared to seltos in all aspects. Looking forward in future
"Don't buy this car, they don't have any customer service. The milage of the car is under 10. Only exteriors are looking good, but built quality is inferior. Delivery may take 100 days. Led experience is very bad.
No service center to get car repaired."
Great car.. far more better then Creta.. excellent biult quality & loads of features..better driving experience on bumpy roads.. no sound of diesel engine inside the car.. feels just like you are driving a petrol model?
The car is a Premium suv car. To improve our style & personality. Lots of features & safety advantage in this car. This is so my feature & lots fun in this car. I am glad to join in kia motors & kia family to share this wonderful experience. If more details then Contact me 7*2*****68 Niral MeswaniyaÂ NANA
"An amazing car with muscular body structure and bit more comfort inside 
And dont underrate the power of 1.5 diesel motor 
Its the most feature full car in its segment 
I didnt drive the petrol one but it is definitely good option also 
Fule economi is also decent considering its price range 
All-over a good package in its segment"
Awesome car with lot of features loaded and driving experience is jus mind-blowing. Best car in the segment no doubt. Many segment first features will impressive you and with the pricing undoubtedly Kia Seltos will rule the segment.  I am 6" and felt very much comfortable in front and rear seats as well. Turbo Petrol ultimate power ratios.
"Beauty and the beast itself a car with excellent performance with modern styling unique at reasonable price with all these features this car will definitely give hard time to its rivals
In all weather conditions it performance is enough to lure drivers from highways to mountains car performance always give confidence to its driver."
"Great car and having macho look.Provide an excellent features at lower price also.Value for money.
Very impressive design.Interior is far better than other same segment SUVs.Best SUV in its segment."
It's awesome car, I would like to buy but i am confused which models, I am confused and I think htk is best value for money and gtk is best to buy but i am confused please tell me.
"The car is jerky and priced very high for the kind of room it provides. Interior is good and good color choices but is unlike price wise in the same category.

Captur diesel at 12.5 lakh manual fully loaded is a much better choice.

The car is good for highway drive. However, the initial pick up is jerky and is not properly tuned with DCT."
"The car is very luxurious and Audi also can't defeat this car.If you are planning to take a luxurious car at the lowest price this is the right car.The sound of the engine from the cabin is not heard.But the one didn'tlike is that the model.In GT line diesel engine is not available only the petrol engine is available 
THIS CAR IS CRAZY AND AMAZING."
Htx plus have 40 to 50 thousand high priced  according to its size and less features as compare to GT line .A new company new product and less market value because of new brand starting period price is high . To make the customer trust and good value for money product  kia have need to reduce the price
"Drive comfort is good 
Suspension is not up to the mark
Interior is awesome 
Mileage is fair 
Wheel base is 17â€™
Leg room is quiet sufficient 
Projector lights from base version
Fair boot space"
Too many variants makes us confused. All safety features provided in GT line and only 2 safety options provided in Tech line. Only GT line being promoted and Tech line cars showed as poor man car. Very less cabin space same as hatchback car. Still confused to buy or not. Top end not being justified against their price approx 19.5 lakhs.
Dream vehicle. Now indian car industry got the real worth car. This is the car we are waiting. All the very best Kia motors.  Kia will ruin the next era of Indian car industry. Kia keee jai. Kia... Kia... Kia. All the features added in the car is very price worthy... Love u Kia motors... Where are you till now?
Firstly Kia entered into Indian market like a Super star movie, most of the people are waiting for its launch eagarly since ever it got into design & finally it came with the best quality fit & finish, with very modern looks with practical features & many 1st in segment features which even doesn't have in much upper segment cars also, surely Seltos will do well in auto market right now with even slow down
"I took test drive HTX plus MT car (diesel) on Guntur Chennai  National high way and the drive was superb. I drove it just 20 Kms, touched  150km  and vehicle was sturdy and very nice. Car is really good and your (CARWALE)analysis helped  me a lot   in choosing GT line. In fact I have booked GTX plus 1.4 and taking delivery on Sunday. I will  post my full fledged reviews later.

THANK YOU"
"The all new KIA Seltos is an amazing car with a lot of power the car has any amazing power which reaches 0-100 in 6 second in top variant and the infotainment is amazing that no one would get bored in their journey  regarding comfort it comes with a leather it gives immense comfort but rear leg room is
a bit low hence it gives a bit discomfort for personal who require a lot space the telematic function gives a high level  of security and convenience. The exterior lighting is amazing that the lamp shines too bright it gives a bright visibility in dark road.Out of 10 I would rate 9 for the car"
"Overall is good excellent clutch gear space is very good overall car is very nice diesel model is very good I have a good experience
The car interior is cool
Car maintenance 3 years warranty is excellent
Boot space is good
This is car actual xuv off road on road driving is very smooth I like this girl"
Kia Motors Very Beauty Full Design and Good Looking and Class Smart Interiors and Very smooth driving. We have also booked the seltos top model deisal variant. We will tell all our friends that in this budget, any S U V is much better than taking seltosNANA
I think kia is the best suv in this budget. I really Like all features. And best features like sunroof ventilated seats wireless charging side camera led tail lamp led fog lamp and i specially like air purifiers best car. Really great Kia. and I also like the legroom. Automatically boot opener and much more. This car beat tata harrier hyundai creta mg hector. If u have to plan to buy mini SUV then go for it. Especially gt line up best work.NANA
"It's phenominal engine and gearbox it's has rubber band effect and loaded with features and it's good stability control and smooth and soft steering 
Doors and very hard metel   quality used in Kia???? and interior quality is top class great job 

One word to day it's worth for money and go for it  Kia always Kia"
The GT Line Auto is really peppy and fun to drive around. Linear accelleration and power distribution and an overall smooth drive. Braking with Brake Assist takes a bit of getting used to. Clocks 0-100 kmph with minimum fuss and contrary to some reports here, doesn't roll into corners at all ... Unless Ur really pushing (read punishing) the car. Smooth gear shifts on the 7 speed DCT auto and no apparent turbo lag detected in the short time I spent with the car. If Kia can manage the aftersales and manage the durability factor, this car is an absolute winner! PS- This car cries out for a 4X4 option...
This car best car I love this car it has good avergae and I gives us lovelly experience I like all the features I am to talk to all the person's to buy this car. This is car breaking power us best
"Today taken test drive of kia seltos..... If one want to spend 15 lakh bucks for boss music system, 360Â° camera, other electronic features he can, but ride quality and drive quality is not better than wagon R. 
As far as ratio of ride quality and cost is concerned I will give 1*,
Even the smallest bump or pits on road give you a jerk, very poor suspension.
Full of electronics but very poor mechanical comfort."
"The car is good enough for a person who has been in a position of this item.  This has a new  features at a low price which is so good . It drives very smoothly and lightly. It has very new looks and has fantastic performance. It has a very good facility.  A good space inside it. It has a very  comfartable seats.

????"
The petrol variant with turbocharger is ultimate it gives a boom performance to the drive and the built quality is also good ..doors are heavy but one drawback is the ground clearance if it's comes in SUV category it should have more ground clearance..but I liked the petrol engine (turbocharged) the one is awesome
"The car is tailor made for the family looking for feature rich experience in low budget without compromising on styling and features. Super drive quality and awesome road presence. As per me it's the best looking car in this segment. As per the company the maintenance of the car would be the least in its segment and spare parts would be available in all major metro cities. Complaint with BSVI thus making the car for future as well. 

Pros:
1. Value for money
2. Styling
3. Features
4. 3year Unlimited kilometer waranty with 2year extended warranty available
5. Ride experience is major plus

Cons:
1. New product need to wait for few months for more detailed review. 
2. Servicing would be bit on rush as few centers available initially but I guess that can be managed as company would expand

As per me go for it for the features and ride experience. Plus the pricing has killed all the competitors according to me. Great product KIA."
The car looks stunning in the front especially with crown jewels led headlamps and DRLs everything is clear and neat in the rear too. I drove a Diesel version which is betterry smooth a very bit lag in 2 to 3 gear.but overall they maintained the smoothness.we drove a top-end which is  eight way adjustment seat a bit annoying to make  me sit comfortably.i think manual adjustment make a sense.but if we c a top-end absolutely we love it.but when we saw a base varient may be we won't like it considering price hte diesel is very good.but led is missing in 11 lakhs car which is bit disturbing.i think soon they vl put a service centres in all areas.considering price am not buying this.but overall the car is very nice in htx,gtx and ok with htk.
"Test drive was amazing KIA made fantastic car .

Major competitor arrived market which made.Worth of money which even prices are at par compare to TATA HARRIER CRETA JEEP COMPASS .The look of car is fabulous with various color combination. Interior look will attract maximum customers.Hope the maintenance cost also lower compare to maruti suzuki cars 

KIA you rock keep up guys"
"I have pre booked kia seltos in july 31st and expect the dilvery by 15th october as confirmed by kia showroom excutive pune. It feels like luxury car from inside and outside. Haven't got a chance to test CVT model but i drove manual and feels like it is good enoughto manage in all day to day stuations and long highway trios as well.
Pricing would not better as it is already attactive in pricing and styling.

Peace !"
Design of this car is really amazing. Advance features really amazing. And pricing of this vehicle is quite fair in accordance with features and design. I have checked this vehicle at Mandi HP in Kia showroom. Quite impressed with features like advanced touchscreen infotainment system,  fully digital instrument cluster and a powered driverâ€™s seat, Ventilated front seats, on-board Wi-Fi, wireless phone charging, ambient lighting, 360-degree parking camera and head-up display
This car is the best car, interior and exterior r best,rate of this car is reasonable,best suv car for long drive ,ground clearance is also ok.looks and lights r very attractive.i love this car
Wonderful car. I must say to take test drive and then purchase this car and enjoy the luxury. All the features the Car has is truly amazing and give us the luxury and more comfort.
No comments in this car compare to Audi and Mercedes. when this car is running in the road every person is look  this car.i think kia is sucess to grow their business in india also running is all over world.
Looks are amazing.KIA gained their popularity with their awsome tvcs.first they were cautious .when the knew that people had garnered interest,they priced to high.it was definitely a FOOLISH step by them.never by this.
Full marks for technology used and finish of interior and exterior, really a great mix of design and technology, I think this is the dream car for everyone, must have this. Also this car will give good competition to manufacturer's to make better car in terms of technology and comfort. I am going to drive this to my home.Great combination.
Some time people they never see their budget and buy the car without getting full knowledge of them i recomend those going to buy read every thing then buy and enjoy the driving experience for this car this car going very high performance and acheive the national award of this year comfertable feel.
It seems like a good suv .having a nice eye-catching look,good interiors which provide excellent comfort and it has top advanced safety features,and all this comes under a reasonable price.I liked this car very much
"? Amazing car with good power in this prize range.
? Look is awesome specially LED headlights & tailights design will stole everyones heart.
? Interior & exterior looks elegant amoung all cars in this price range which will usually makes you feel rich & attractive.
? Only thing that disappoints me is tyres-R17, it will look much more attractive in tyres-R21 as tata harrier."
The driving dynamics and the outrageous look of the car speaks for itself an engineered efficient vehicle ....well in short kia nailed it and it will be a bang ...The car is new in India but at this price it gives you a lot more than its competitors. IN SERVICE YOU CAN FACE A BIT HARDSHIP AS IT HAS JUST ENETERED INDIA BUT STILL ITS AVAILABLE IN ALL MAJOR CITIES AND MAINTAINACE WILL BE TAKEN CARE OF .
"The dream car with all the latest features is finally here. Its looks are fabulous . The ideal car for both city and long drive. The connectivity feature is unique and responsive. The height of the car is good enough for even off reading, the powerful engine and good suspension makes the ride comfortable.
The only thing that bother at present is after sales service centres are few. May be the company has plans to increase service points in the future.
All the best Kia Motors."
"Kia seltos is an amazing car loaded with lots of features with 360 degree cameras, ventilated seats, heads up display, 6 air bags, etc... this is the Most awaited car for me.

Value for the price . I have driven GT edition, it's amazing experience with kia. 

Kia has done a great job. Expecting more cars like this."
Best class in comapct suv stylish design eye catching look good ground clearance best interior nice steering all color are awesome my future's car shoot on my style best music system powered by bose
"This car for ?20 Lakh is an expensive proposition. It is very well featured but lacks subtlety. It is too peppy /jerky for a city drive. On highway though it is a very good drive. Seltos is not spacious when compared to Hector and Harrier. Mileage in city is about 10+ and on highway 15+.

Car is a stunner lookwise but is certainly overpriced by atleast couple of lakhs."
"It seems underpowered as well as poor suspention. Doesn't feel safe while driving.
Kia is only provided fancy features but they intentionally tring there customers to driver from build quality, safety and importantly legroom and shoulder room."
"It Is good car with all compartments like which we compare to high-end car
Exterior was too good
Performance was extreme
Coming to top-end model is same as range Rover 
Lights were extreme"
Really excellent car and looking so good.over all super car in compare to other. so smart in segment.i like so much i want to purchase petrol automatic within this month but waiting period is too much high.
"This car looks very amazing and eye catching
Performance of engine is very impressive
Boot space is very big
Leg room inside the car is quite good
A/c is very efficient
Handling is amazing"
Awesome car having quality features so need to forgo any other car just go for it and believe on its quality and quantity. It will give you value of your money and belive on it so guys its my view
First of all its a Korean brand, you get a feel-good material inside and out, loads of features of course, however, what brings me down is the engine reliability of Korean brands, they are no way near Japanese brands league and I meant nowhere near. Korean brands have unnecessarily ridiculous expensive parts which make no sense at all.being a Korean brand and still expensive parts, really. Unreal. That's why your high-end cars are almost extinct. To all the Korean car manufacturers, please make the reliable engine and drop your car parts prices where you compensate all your expenditure on high-end cars which are almost invisible on roads.
"Being a new brand in India the sales team was really aggressive in sales. I got my car within 2 days
The drive is really convenient in heavy city traffic and with an automatic gearbox and excites features its easy to ride especially on Indian roads.
My friends drove it and they are making a plan to buy instead pf Innova Crysta."
"It's look is very good especially in orange colour and red colour it's interior design and outer design is the best its value for money  it's driving is so smooth and it's seats are very comfortable especially it's lights are so good it's features are very very very good i am very happy that I have a car like this thanks Kia 
I will only say if you are searching for a car you should buy this car"
"Car is overpriced by about a lac..may be due to overwhelming response during pre-booking....not good in the long run. 
Cancelled my booking. 
Some Safety features should have been provided in HTX + to make it a complete family car"
very good car. But since very first day, i notice a very annoying sound coming from the rear of the vehicle. I tried to reach the customer support. First it is impossible to find the number or email id. and i have not even received any call back to find out or resolve the same
Super car for small family .it is an allrounder car with good space good ground clearence .I liked.because we are small family some times we need to go to our village and because of good ground clearence very comfortable and and we use to bring so many things from village and it helps alot because of huge luggage space.
looking good best in class lower price then MG and hariier. colour inbulit quality awesome . kia logo Rotate  into alloy looking wowsoke and front lamp also awesome look of front 100 out of hundered
"Car look wise is awesome , muscular body, a perfect Sports Utility vehicle 
Very comfortable while driving and well equipped with all the features 

The rear seat passenger seat is very comfortable best that support, seat cushioning is good"
"Exterior Really great and looks good compared to SUV's in the same league.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)Â Quality of interior is good . However it is higly disappointing that Jeep has not provided reverse camera which is an essential requirement even in its longitude (O) variant.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and GearboxÂ I bought my Jeep compass(Diesel, 4X2)Â two months back and within few days of purchase, I have observed a high level of rattling sound from the engine. Sound was so irritating and often happens while accelerating at 2nd and 3rd gears and sound vanishes when accelerate further and Â gets past 2000. Finally, I have observed that engine making rattling only when it is Â starts from cold start condition and it persists nearly one hour. To my great greatest surprise, it was found that rattling noise vanishes when the engine stop and start again. I have demonstrated the problem to the dealer and they are now taking up the matter with manufacturer. I am looking forward for the action from Jeep.
Ride Quality & Handling Good.
Final WordsÂ Being an iconic brand, Jeep shoud have done more R&D on engine to avoid the issues with the engine sound.
Areas of improvementÂ Additional features like reverse camera and larger infotainment screen.Exterior, styleEngine rattling noise in cold start condition, Less features"


"I bought aÂ Jeep Compass on 28/1/2018Â andÂ yesterday on 04/02/2018Â my car gotÂ broke downÂ on the highway some where around 200 km away from my home.
i don't know how a new car startedÂ vibrating and it was making noise, it was soÂ humiliating and embarrassingÂ for meÂ  because i was with my family and relatives on a holiday trip and then this happened to me,Â Â my cousins were making jokes and laughing on the car (On ME),Â the company dealer is saying that they have identified the problem and resolved it but i am so pissed off with the car that i don't want it back, so either youÂ buy backÂ the car and give me my money back or either give me aÂ new pieceÂ because if the product is doing this within 7 days of purchase than I am sorry but I don't have any future expectations with this.Â 
Â 
so just looking into this matter and resolve my issue because i don't expected this sort ofÂ CHEAPÂ performance from a company likeÂ JEEP
Â 
samarth jain
meerut
Â 
Â lookspoor quality, issues in the engine in just one week"
"We brought a jeep compass about 20 days back.Â  On receiving the vehicle, there was a constant clatter from the front pair of doors or panels.Â  On reporting this, they took the vehicle to the workshop promptly, reporting post return, the issue has been resolved.Â  In turn, while one door, the noise had dampened, though not eradicated, on the other door, the sound had increased.Â  Now I have to myself try multiple maneuvres to try and reduce the noise.Â  The staff were helpful in the showroom but frankly, they are sales people and they could hardly make out the real issue.Â  Now I am still awaiting a call from their Pune office to correct the issue and mind you, this is only 28 days post buying the vehicle.
All in all, at this price, it is a huge huge disappointment.Â  FCA/Mopar - you really need to take care of your standards.
Worst experience!!!The drive experienceQuality checks are an issue"


"ExteriorÂ Head turner, stunning looks, Strongly built, very heavy as well. Front Grill with Jeep Brand stands out. started loving bad roads now (bangalore). Great presense on the road.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)Â Good features. Comfortable at all positions, strong AC and good music system. Enough space for boh rows. storage is very good
Loved carplay, button hand break, and multiple usb ports, dual AC temperatures, even the horn and lights.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and GearboxÂ Smooth gear box, very good engine and decent fuel economy.
Ride Quality & HandlingÂ Amazing riding experience, you wont feel any bad road now, real SUV feel. very steady at high speeds. cruises on highway. Overtakes 0-100 in few seconds
Final WordsÂ Best buy if you want a premium SUV. its truely premium feel inside and outside. enough of mahindra copying jeep all their life.
Great car for every road and SAFEST for your family than the japanese cars
Areas of improvementÂ Add sun roof, Automatic (in diesel), auto closing of windows/side mirrors.Super Power/ Torque, Strongly built/safe, Amazing looksnothing"
"I am facing the death wobble issue in my NEW Jeep compass, I was near to hump and applied break and the car started shaking violently. This is a terrible issue and can cause accidents.Â 
I have talked to the dealer and they are not aware of this issue. They told they will look into this issue and rectify it. But I feel the technician who knows the problem can only fix it. Jeep should recall all cars and fix it.Â 
When you google you will find their are more jeep owners faced this problem and it persists from last 10+ years, how jeep is selling thier cars in India without fixing the problem. Time to think that you will see so many motivated videos regarding Jeep compass great personalities whom you can trust.Style built qualityThey should have rectified this issue"
"Before I start the detailed review, let me express a concern over the genuinity of the reviews posted by people who don't own the vehicle. For those who go by cumulative rating, 3.5 stars seems way too less. But the fact is that some of the disgruntled users who had issues with dealerships had a major hand in the same.
When Jeep Compass released in India, it was crearly 1 segment above my reach from my 2011 Toyota Etios G Petrol. I had hardly driven 40K in 7 years and was absolutely in love with driving comfort of my vehicle. I had to go for a segment upgrade and was searching for a 7 seater and then Jeep happened.
The thought of owning a premium truly international SUV at that price tag, made me jump one segment higher and even moved me away from 7 seater segment. I got the vehicle booked under my employer's lease plan - but changed the booking in my name at the last moment due to some reason. Result, I had no waiting that seems to be the biggest concern here.
I got the vehicle delivered on Jan 7th 2018 - Minimal Grey (I had the roof painted black for 20 K from showroom, which I feel is worth every paisa).
Exterior The Black roof gave the machine a range roversque look and I was the first in my firm to own one. To put it briefly, it made me famous - very famous. Everyone knew the guy who had the Jeep. The build quality was evident when I had an accident where the left front wheel arch and left side view mirror went under a National Permit Lorry while attempting a riskyÂ overtaking maneuver. Had it been any other vehicle, the left side view mirror would have shattered. Here, it simply folded and resumed all relectronic functionality once retracted. The wheel arch suffered a minor dent, which was fixed off-show room for a nominal expense.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
Features:
All safety features that Jeep offers are premium and have experienced the traction control, ECS,HSA and ABS in real time. Fortunately there was no need for Air-bag deployment. Worth the money! The Uconnect entertainment system easily paired Apple phones via Apple Car Play butyou can have multiple devices paired, including Android. There are two USB charging points one in the front and one in the rear. Air Conditioning is efficient with both front and rear vents. Once paired, you can use SIRI or accept calls from steering controls. You can change the songs or skip FMs from steering controls. The volume control is also provided below steering. Handbrake is electronic, which requires minimal effort.Sound system with 6 speaker and all weather subwoofer in middle of dashboard is pure bliss. Side-view mirror vissibility can be electonically adjusted. Wipers are efficient.
Space & Comfort:
Having not used an SUV before and comparing Toyota's etios, which is several segments below Jeep, I can confidently say that a sedan is a sedan and no SUV can match the comfort it offers. But again, one should not compare apples to oranges.Â  The biggest disappontment was that Jeep could not make it a comfortable 5 seater at the least. Rear middle passenger is really cramped (This with every passenger falling below 60 KG) and not suitable for long drives. The rear vissibility is also poor from rear view mirror when 3rd passenger occupies the seat. Boot Space is OKyish - If the boot fills up, rear view mirror vissibility is again impacted.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
Engine Performance:
This is where Jeep blew me away, FCA's 2.0 diesel engine is too good to be true. I had driven my etios for 40 K kms in 7 years. I have almost completed 10 K in my compass in under 3 months. It is a driver's dream. Driving comfort is unparallaled.Â 
Fuel Economy:
I followed the instructions from showroom of not exceeding 130 KM/H speed before 2000 KMs and got a mileage of close to 20 km/l in my first long trip to Munnar from Bangalore via Salem. There was minimal gear shifting required and I drove at constant 100 km/h speed. But it significantly drops with constant gear shifts and raising the vehicle suddenly.
Ride Quality & Handling Ride Quality is good, when it is used as a four seater. As per my family, it does not match the comfort of our etios. Handling is amazing.
Final Words This one is a head turner. Like old Onida Ad, world's envy, owner's pride. If only FCA could do something to increase the comfort of rear passengers, it would be really hard to beat Jeep in the segment.
Areas of improvement Ride comfort and rear seat. Boot Space. Rear view mirror vissibility.Great Style and decent fuel economyRear seats are cramped - Strictly a four seater if using for long trips"
"I am an Air Force Officer and was impressed by the Jeep 4X4 month offer and went to a dealer in Bangalore for enquiring about the same. I had carried my cheque book to book the vehicle in anticipation of an honest interaction with the sales person.
I first asked him about the CSD price list. He said that he doesn't have it. From the tone and tenour of his reply It appeared that he was giving me the concession and not the government. Then I enquired about the 4X4 month. Initially he was skirting the issue, and on my insistance and pointing out to a promo lying on the table, he confirmed there was such a scheme. I told him that I am waiting for some money as my mutual fund has matured and hence would book it ASAP. To this he said that I must book it immediately. He said that if the vehicle is delivered in May, then I will not get the offer.
I replied to him that the information I have is that if I book it before 30 Apr, I will be able to avail it. He again repeated that if the deliver is in May then he cannot give me the offer.
I was feeling that I was not sitting with a salesman of a reputed brand like Jeep. It was like sales at gunpoint. ""I cant say prices will increase etc..."" It was like sitting on the edge of a cliff waiting to be pushed off.
The product is very good, but this is not the end. But arrogant people like this waiting toÂ  I have to go to these kind of people for service for the rest of the vehicles life. It is very difficult to do that after today's experince. When they can renege on their word today, they will do it every day
Hence I have glad that I did not sink my money into this unwelcome pit.The BrandArrogant Staff"
"My favorite  and dream  car it's smooth driving  and high speed engine  colors very very love it..... My 

The 2018 Compass is available in four trim levels: Sport, Latitude, Limited and Trailhawk. All come with a 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine (180 horsepower, 175 pound-feet of torque). A six-speed manual transmission is standard on the Sport, and a six-speed (FWD) or a nine-speed (AWD) automatic transmission is optional. All other Compass trims have the automatic as standard equipment. Front-wheel drive is standard and all-wheel drive is option"
"A CAR NOT TO BUY
                                        
This car's turbo sets in around 2500 rpm. Till it reaches this rpm the car hardly moves, then suddenly it flies off the handle. This is impossible to control under most circumstances. In my opinion it is an accident waiting to happen. When i bring this up with the service station they just shrug it off as normal in all Jeep cars.

It has pathetic fuel efficiency. Be that as it may the engine capacity is so small that the car needs refueling constantly. I cannot go from Bangalore to Mysore and back without refueling.

I discovered this pretty early after buying the car. I decided to sell if even before i reached 1000 kms and one month after i purchased the car. When i inquired the purchase price, i was not even getting a quote for 17 lakhs. I paid 24.66 lakhs for the car. Though most cars lose their value once you drive out of the showroom, the Jeep's resale demand is non existent.

In my opinion these cars should be banned from sale in India"
No customer service.buying this car in December 2017. front headlight not working properly then I go to jeep service center..service manager told me without check my car sir car is absolutely fine. Pathetic experienceNANA
"It is good in or better in interior and facilities and bad in pick up,avg and service ,worst in avg claiming 15km and giving 7 km 
Response zero from company, I bought from Surat and in bought as useful car as automatic but facing difficulty in city also ,all other way good and no doubt about safety and interior ,workmanship good ,but expecting whatever company claiming should we get at least 90%
Hope company will contact and resolve issue"

"I would like to talk about the performance. There is an inherent Clutch/gear issue. My clutch burnt at 13000 kms. The service center states that, the vehicle is not suitable for city conditions and the clutch has relatively smaller grooves, which makes it wear out faster. They claim, they have reported to the Jeep, but not sure if they will take any action.

I got the clutch replaced, and am now getting clucking sound, whenever I change the gears, or slow down/speedup. The service center states its normal, but i can clearly see that, its not RIGHT. I have now no idea what to do now!!!"
"I am jeep owner from almost 2 years and after driving it more than 40k km I am writing this review. I don't advise people to buy it. Following are the pros and cons

Pros.....  1) Its built quality and exterior is good.
2)  You get good grip and control on high speed on highways. 

Cons...... 1) Jeep compass probably the worst SUV in its segment which has extremely poor and if I have to be blunt then pathetic turning radius and you literally have to take reverse on each U-turn in the city and if you are driving it cities like Mumbai, Bangalore then you are done.
2) even after taking care of the vehicle and getting  it serviced on time the car started making noise. It's arm rest makes noise even the cover around steering wheel also not fitted well which also makes noise.
3) someone broke my wind shield which I got it replaced with new one but the size of new wind shield is little small and has not been fixed well it is making sound from the moment I got it fixed.
4) Most important point its engine stopped 3 times once on Express Highway and did not start then you have to wait for 20 minutes to get it started again which is terrible for a SUV where you have paid 20L. Even my 12 years old Honda City Engine never had this issue.
5) fabric seat covers after paying 20L is something you don't expect.

In my opinion you should go for other SUVs instead of putting 20L in this or wait for another year to get better options as it has all basic features which you can get in any 10-12L car except electronic hand break.

I bought this car thinking that its American brand and its going to be good product and after sales service but they have failed in both. They are selling inferior quality or they couldn't import quality which they sell in US or they are purposely selling poor quality products thinking that it's India and they can twist rules and regulations the way they want."
I purchased this car in recently and drove 800km in all conditions (in city/ highway etc---). I am getting an average mileage of  5.4 km/litre instead of 12-14 which company is offering. Please check the mileage of this car before buying this variant. It is a petrol variant with an engine capacity is 1.4, not worth to drive this car if you get an average of 5.4/km.
"ExteriorÂ I don't really like huge SUV's (like the Fortuner or Endeavour) and in my opinion the Compass is just perfect. Its not too small and not too big. The design compliments the size very well giving it a superb road presence. I love the side profile and that chrome strip that differentiates the rood and the rest of the body. I love the rear which is complimented with a nicely done LED tail lights. (even non-led's looks good).
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)Â Top notch interiors made from great quality materials. The leather seats, soft touch dash, soft touch top portion on the front doors and that superbly finished leather wrapped steering gave me a sense of luxury right away. The doors close with a nice sound and bloody hell its hefty. I got into the driver seat & pulled the centre arm rest froward and adjusted it to my driving position and boy it felt like a tank once I was done. There is a sense of security which I have never felt in any other car I've driven so far. Space is good in the front but spaces to put phones and other items lack a bit.
With the front seats in my driving position, I got into the rear and it was spacious enough. The seats are great but the middle portion lack underthigh support. The rear arm rest is super wide and it felt like the car is best for 4 adults. Overall 4 adults and a kid is ideal or 3 medium sized adults.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and GearboxÂ I'm a true petrol head and the diesels I've driven so far (S-cross 1.3 and Polo) had failed to impress me with the turbo lag and I expected the same since the compass has a bigger engine and bigger turbo, but boy the engine and the power delivery blew me away. The engine is smooth and there is no jerk whatsoever when the turbo kicks in. With 5 well weighed adults in the car, it pulled from 1400rpm in 3rd gear with ease. It was so linear and clean that it almost felt like I was driving a powerfull petrol mill. The gear shifts are notchy which is well complimented by a nicely weighed clutch. The steering has a lot of feedback and weight and it instantly gave me a smile.
Ride Quality & HandlingÂ Handlig was great, I didn't feel like driving a 1.5 ton machine but there is a sense of heft and I think its mainly because of the well weighed chunky steering and the tank feel the Compass has.
I cannot comment much on ride quality since I drove on a good surface but on that it as good and the car changed directions with confidence and ease.
Final WordsÂ I'm in love with this car and there is no other way to put. If I was in the market to get a car around 15lakhs, I would happily put 5lakhs more and will get the Longitude (O) model since it has the most bang for the buck. We can spend 10k for Jeep's original leather wrapped steering (5k) and reverse camera (5k) to add to the Longi (O) and make it a limited model without LED tail lights and leather seats.
Areas of improvement
1. Should have had 6 airbags on limited 4x2 at least.
2. Should introduce the 8.4"" uConnect system since the 7"" one is laggy.
3. Cruise control and auto dimming IRVM would be a great addition.
PS : I cannot care less about having a sunroof and auto headlamps and wipers.Styling, Built Quality, Chunky Steering, Superb Engine and gearbox, Front Seats7"" UConnect system lags, Lack of 6 airbags for 4x2 variants (not even limited 4x2), Cruise Control"
"I got a chance to Drive this Car.  I got the Trailhawk DSG  2 ltr engine This engine Gives a lot of Power It's Really Awesome I don't have any words to Say About This Engine It's Really Awesome. Up to 2000 rpm There is a Lag but it's Pull so quickly and The Performance of this car absolutely Phenomenal. The 9speed DSG gearbox gives More performance And The hydraulic steering Gives a Lot of Confidence At high speed and The Main advantage of This car has No Body roll we Get Comfortable Riding In this car. And The Rear Passenger Gets  Arm Rest and AC vents. If you Looking For an SUV go and Buy this.

The buying experience was good. The only mistake I did, never checked the mileage of the car. I believed the sales person who told me the average mileage is 14-17km/L. The Jeep team is not ready to accept the mileage issues. I have sent several mails to the entire Jeep team and there were no reply and solution. I am getting an average mileage of 5-6KM/L after driving 2500km with different conditions. My humble request to all customers who are planning to buy Jeep compass, please check the mileage on different conditions (traffic /non traffic etc.) to get the real mileage. Do not believe the sales person who just want to sell the car.

"ExteriorÂ Great body, tough and head turner.Â 
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)Â Good features like eletronic break, comfortable seats and easy to drive.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and GearboxÂ I usually drive at maximum speed of 80-100, I have got fuel economy as 16.5 to 18km/l in city conditions and on highway it was 20 to 22.5km/l.
Ride Quality & HandlingÂ Great one.
Final WordsÂ I bought limited(O) diesel from Mohali dealership on 10th January 2018 and I must say my experience till now is great in all aspects.When I confirmed my purchase, I got delivery next day as one day took for banking formalities. That was amazing experience. The dealership here in Mohali is very professional and customer oriented, they even changed the car before delivery as I found one paint issue in the previous car and they provided a new car. They gave me plenty of time to check and verify the car again till I got satisfied.
Till now I have driven around 4800 kms and my experience is awesome either in city or highways. As Chandigarh/Mohali doesn't have traffic like Delhi or Mumbai, I am getting mileage of around 16.5 to 18km/lÂ and on highways it gave me maximum of 20.5 to 22.5km/l while driving at maximum speed of 100 km/hour.
I love the interiors, although maintenance is high as seat covers and doors are light colored as per my model but it looks premium. The music system is great as well electronic break, it is a great feature. Also You can manage other stuff within infotainment system like controlling lights, doors, phone etc. People are saying that it doesn't have cruise control but for me it is not essential as in India, roads are not build for it. When you are on highway, any animal or people can come in between. I think sunroof could be a good option if they add in the future as well automatic in diesel. I don't mind manual transmission but automatic is helpful when there are long traffic jams.
As far as car's build is concerned, It is heavy build with great quality. On highway, I had a major accident when a Harley Davidson rammed into right front grill/bumper and to my surprise, It got nothing except a small scratch which was removed by dealership later on. I must say the quality is really good.
Car is a head turner for sure, I have seen how people react when you are on road, it gives a personality and car looks very rugged and manly.
I have heard bad reviews about dealership and services but nothing like this happened to me. Even they gave me training to use infotainment system as well the best way to maintain the car. They are available on one phone call.
I am happy with my choice. If anyone wants to ask anything, feel free to write me.
Areas of improvementÂ Sunroof, cruise control, diesel automatic.Style, manly, rugged, heavy build, secure, great music systemInfotainment system touch screen is slow to response"
Dear Team Greetings...!!! This Email on the behalf of Mr. Mukesh Kaushik, Who is your current customer. We bought a jeep on 24th June 2018n (Automatic) with the hope that we shall be served well and we are buying from one of the most esteemed company. But unfortunately, We have been facing many issues since then and have not received any after sale services. Please refer below to our concerns. At the time of buying, we were told that car gives average of 14, but initially, it gave average 6 and now maximum average I am getting is 7.5. This was updated but the issues were never resolved. We bought the luxury car because we have big Professional group and was very occupied with that but even then we addressed the problems with no answer in return. Also, after 15 days of buying; the Gear Box of the started giving a lot of problems. While using 2nd and 3rd Gear there is a continuous Which keep irritating the Driver. similarly, While using the starting wheel there is a problem of noise while rotating the wheel. Not only this, even if we move out of the car and car key almost 250m away from the car, The car is still unlocked. For that matter, even light does not get off When the car is locked. We have been very busy due to professional and family reason so we expected the company to help us immediately, but even after promising nobody turned up for any help We shall request you to Replace the car so that all our quires are resolved and we can still be a dedicated client to the company. Looking forward for a quick and fruitful response. Kinds Regards Mukesh Kaushik 9xxxxx70xx0 xxxxxsh@sxaxnxdxxdssxxxxx.comNANA
To, JEEP INDIA TEAM. Greetings of the Day !!! I recently bought the much hipped safety oriented INTERNATIONAL car JEEP COMPASS from your S G HIGHWAY BASED CONCEPT DEALER. The reason behind wiring this E-mail is to Replace my Faulty Car with New Jeep Model or money in cash. Just before few days when we were travelling on Ahmedabad to Surat Highway your Jeep Compass had serious build and make issue. While the running conditions at only 90KMPH the Fuel Pump (Diesel) Started Draining out Heavily. But to our fortune we smelled something wrong in the car and we immediately stop it by the side of highway. While inspecting the car on the highway we have found that its fuel pump was full of leakage and the diesel was draining out fast. As you already know that I have purchased it just before 6 Months and has drawn It for just about 20000 Kms with all regular paid services from your dealer. In any case your Jeep Compass Model in India is not conforming to the safety and performance standards of International Level which you try to claim in your much hipped marketing in television and other related medias. However, In that case I want full refund of my money or if you provide me enough assurance that this type of problem will not appear again in your vehicle than I shall be ready to have a new car from your company as a replacement to my existing car. I hope that Jeep India team will understand my situation as I am paying my hard earned money behind your faulty and damaged Jeep Compass car, I shall not be ready to collect back this faulty model from your dealership after repairs and would like to request the competent authority to provide prompt justification in my case on urgent basis. Due to your faulty model Jeep Compass my business plans are totally disturbed and I have already faced a moral and indirect lost of more than 1.5 Lakh Indian rupees during last week. In short, I am providing you the only two options to choose from before I personally litigate you in the court of Law: 1) Refund my Full Money of Jeep Compass and take back your Faulty Vehicle. 2) Replace this Faulty Vehicle with the New Vehicle and Provide me an Assurance in Writing that If the same problem is found (with in12 Months again) in the new piece of vehicle you shall be liable to refund my full money in Cash. I am writing this letter as a formal complain to justify my stand and provide time of 5 Days to your company authority before I initiate a legal procedures against your company and the dealer from where I have been made fool to purchase this faulty and damaged vehicle. Look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible. Regards, MILAN PATEL Unfortunate Owner of You Jeep Compass GJ01XXXXXX AHMEDABAD 9909XXXXXXNANA
"ExteriorÂ The outlook of the car is quite masculine, I love the fact that the design cues have been insprired from the Jeep Grand Cherokee.
The height of the car is also good, its pretty neat car for our Indian roads, which during monsoon become off-roadsÂ 
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)Â The interior of the car is charismatic. Nice tone of black and white.... But I would have preferred an all round black interiors with a hint of red trimmings. That would have made it look more sexy.
The white colour is hard to maintain.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and GearboxÂ The car packs amazing punch in the engine. I've not driven the car yet but just sat in it when it was at display in our city. I have opted for the Diesel Automatic version which is expected to launch in the first week of Jan 2018
Ride Quality & HandlingÂ Again, Ive not driven the car so I cannot comment on this part. But I'm sure, after watching many reviews on youtube, this car is a drivers car!
Final WordsÂ I just hope and wish they dont price the Diesel Auto variant too steep, otherwise it will loose the charm, becasue if it crosses the 25 Lac barrier, then we have more alternatives to look at. Maybe they should launch theÂ Trailhawk version in that price range
Areas of improvementÂ The rear styling is something i did not lilke. Also, if you look at the car from sideways, you will notice that the rear wheels are not fitting perfectly in the rear wheel arch! That came as a surprise to me.
Jeep should giveÂ MoparÂ  accessories in India.The front looks charming, the interiors are pretty good too!The rear tail light is not of my taste, the rear wheels do not fit properly in the wheel arch,"



1. Buying experience was not at all good as the sales executive told us that the milage of car is 17km/lt but it was just 6.5 km/lt. We asked the executive, he said wait for some time it will increase but after first service the result was same. Now its 6 months but not even a km milage has increased and the executive has stopped picking up the call.


"On 27th July 2018 I was coming from Kapurthalla to Delhi, around 8:00 AM at Ambala my car (JEEP Campus HR 26 DJ 1503) stops and doesen't start.
I called RSA same time from Ambala, RSA team came at my place at 3:30 PM to pick my car. Then they take my car at JEEP Karnal Service center, there they took around 24 HRS to fix the issue, after reaching home I see that my Front Left tyre has some bubbles in it (which was changed / dameged by JEEP Karnal Service center).
I visited JEEP Service Center, Gurgaon on 3rd August 2018 to check the issue, there I can see that they put Maruti Alto car on shop flor and repairing the same, after making my many request they didn't lisiten to me(They told that we will repair MARUTI car first after that we will see JEEP). I called Mr. Tanuj Gupta (RSM), that doesn't support as well, after making my many call to custmer care arund 3:30 HRS they attend my car.Look of CarQuality of Car (It stops automatically on highway and doesn't start), Service centers are not good"



"Jeep compass is a very good suv and it is dominant in its segment.
It has awesome looks and has a good powerful engine.
The brand jeep is enough to stand apart.
The price is little bit high."

Super ride . Amazing features .nice suspension and heavy hard body . Excellent interior.  coaching. music system. Steering height and movable system. cruise control .gear system is very soft. Projector headlamps  mirror indicators Mag Wheel alloy wheel  nice looking design .super SUV car overall Amazing car

"9 Km per Liter
Battery went off in 15 months
Now key Hob Battery went off in 18 months 
First service and noticed a full scratch on my allow unfortunately after 1 day
Dealer was charging issuance of ?96000 as against ?55000 when confronted with insurance outside 
Charged ?28000 for Nano paint which seems to be useless 
Promised to deliver the car and while I was almost  there I got a call that I will get the car after 3 days
The address on RC was for somewhere I have never lived 
Now they are asking for extended warranty for ?31000 which is almost unreasonable and they know the customer does not have a choice 

ABSOLUTE NO AND MY BAD INVESTMENT"
"Donâ€™t buy it from Jayaraj Motors (Tiruchirappalli)!! I purchased a â€˜Jeep Compass Limitedâ€™ vehicle on March 2018 in the name of my company â€˜*Rubine Glass Pvt Ltd*â€™ at Jayaraj Motors, Tiruchirappalli, Tamilnadu. While purchasing I was told by the sales rep Mr. Jambukeshwar and Sales Manager (I think so) Muthu that there is no discount available for Jeep Compass even if 2 or 3 nos of vehicles bought together. This had been their repeated answer when I insisted for discount.
After purchasing the vehicle, my company was followed up many times by their (Jayaraj Motors) staff Mr. Jambukeshwar in the month of April to purchase second vehicle of same model with a discount of ?80,000/-.
When it was brought to my notice, I contacted Mr. Jambukeshwar and expressed my discontent for the false & unethical statement given to me during the time of first vehicleâ€™s purchase and insisted to offer the discount of? 40000 for the first vehicle. After a long discussion, Mr. Jambukeshwar agreed that ?25000 of discount for my vehicle even in the case of second vehicle not purchased. When I contacted him for the cheque for the discounted amount and overpaid amount for Engine Insurance, he said only? 15000 as discount along with the overpaid amount can be given stating that as per MDâ€™s instruction.
Since I was not in an mood to make it a scene, I asked him to pay the amount immediately. Again after few days, when I contacted him he said he was relieved from the company and Ms. Uma and Mr. Muthu will handle the issue of returning the amount. When I contacted Ms. Uma, she accepted that jambu had instructed to pay the amount and she was waiting for companyâ€™s MDâ€™s signature on the cheque.
This was going on for around 3 weeks stating that â€˜MD is not in the city.â€™ After she asked me to contact Mr. Muthu stating he will handle on this regard. When I explained Mr.Muthu over phone, he said he would speak to MD and get the amount. Irrespective of my repeated reminders to him in a space of every two days, he kept on saying the different excuses for almost a month. Thereafter, he started avoiding my phone calls.
(Only auto messages are received that he would contact shortly). Then, I wrote to their MD Mr. Ajay on 12th July about all what happened in the perception that he wouldnâ€™t have known their Staffâ€™s irresponsible and false commitments. He immediately responded that action will be taken. But till date, no action was taken. Itâ€™s really hurting and I feel insulted & cheated as a customer. And because of this, I couldnâ€™t even enjoy the feel and ride of my new vehicle.
But, I donâ€™t have any complaints about the vehicle. As of now, It is to my expectation. But, donâ€™t buy it from an irresponsible and unethical dealer like Jayaraj Motors. Or negotiate with them like in a vegetable market (but nowadays, their prices are trustworthy) and get it in writing. More you bargain, more discount you may get (apart from company offers). These guys will surely spoil the reputation of the brand â€˜JEEPâ€™ in India..

"Jeep compass
                         The most awarded SUV I am so proud that I own this premium SUV it's best to drive it's ready to give you the sudden pick up you want, it's also provides panaromic sunroof."
"While buying Landmark sales team did a poor job of committing the date of delivery and then changing at the time when we almost reached the showroom

Secondly the insurance quoted amount was more than ?90,000 and when compared to other insurance company, it came down to ? 58000

Battery just after 14 months has drained out and they simply responded car is under 3 years warranty, not battery, not sure what more will not be under warranty, only time will tell

Service is average as usual committed to delivery at 4 and finally waited at the service center for 2 more hours 

Costly service , ? 9600 for changing all what is required at the first service, mind it, this is without Kanpur charges, adding that after a period may shoot up

I had Toyota Corolla and never paid more than ?6000 for each service 

The car is underpowered and hence drags at time 

I donâ€™t think one can afford this car for more than 3 years as it may turn out to be a big cost of maintenance"

the service and maintenance of this vehicle is very poor .the technical staff is not competent to diagnose or to rectify the issues in side the vehicle which leads a very uncomfortable experience for a customer.They are only concern with selling of vehicle.so Jeep Compass needs to work on this segment as they have very less service centre and incompetent staff which is giving a very bad impression of a company.as vehicle performance is nice but as service centres are very less .
Look wise very good ,average is also good and it is also 4*4 length wise also good. This car is also in both features auto and manual and ground clearance is also good. All windows are powe base
"Buying experience: Excellent dealership, purchased it 10 months back. Riding experience: It's a wow experience, specially on highway excellent stability even at 160kmpl. No body roll. AC and audio performance top notch
 After 2000rpm it's like ` catch if you can ` . 
Also Stable if Breaking at high speed . Details about looks, performance etc: Head Turner specially Red Color, simple and eligent Interior looks premium with good quality plastics.Bold looks Servicing and maintenance: Not yet experienced. Service center nearby from my residence Pros and Cons: Real SUV, Powerful engine , 160 bhp power for petrol, giving 10 kmpl milage for city,14 kmpl for highway.

 Cons more features required at entry level "
I don't no how to describe its is very comfortable for long drive and the exterior was show awesome and the interior is perfect for the family the fuel is economically and the servicing and maintenance is also convince the price also economically compared to other branded SUV
"It has a modern look which is very attractive .
But jeep maintenance service needs an improvement.It has a great booting space .
It is very easy to handle but at high speed turning is little off ."
This SUV like others is good for indian roads. But it is more luxurious to drive it, a feeling of royalty. Look is good but no panoramic roof. Red color looks most sexy. Service stations are quite far. Price is ok as it is luxurious brand. Otherwise everyone could have purchased it and low down it's market.NANA
"- Mohair Auto NASHIK----------------Please dont   buy vechiles form here, totally casual and non responsible service.
- No commitment, no skilled staff
- Even maruti 800 can give you good response for service.

Pl dont buy"
Riding experience: Super fine to be in the driver seat Details about looks, performance etc: Superb from outside view looks so beautiful 
Best luxury & safe car it's fun to drive car go anywhere it's has all luxury features with powerful performance with trainn system it best performance in all like highway off-road city but for rear passenger want some more space with seat adjuster otherwise it's killer  it's beat ranger over evoke I love it
"Jeep compass car a nice car I love it this car 
 The Black roof gave the machine a range roversque look and I was the first in my firm to own one. To put it briefly, it made me famous - very famous. 
 Ride Quality is good, when it is used as a four seater. As per my family, it does not match the comfort of our swift. Handling is amazing."
"I brought diesel variant car in jan 2019.My experience is just amazing.
The features like Safety, comfort,fabric quality, seating arrangement and attractive look are realy good..I love it's full sunroof"
"You will easily miss this car among the hordes of compact suv nowadays seen on the roads, but Jeep Compass is definitely worth it's price.
The looks are conventional yet appealing, LED headlights and rear lights gives it a distinct look.
17 inch tyres looks good on the body.The car looks beefy yet elegant at the same time.
Enter the cabin and you cocoon yourself from the outside world. The door closes with a thunk which gives you an idea of the built quality.
Start the car and you realize that engine is quiet enough. The audio quality of the infotainment system is good.
The car drives really well at high speeds and is sturdy. While cornering the car it is steady , some body roll is there but ride quality is good.
Small bumps do not filter their way into the cabin.
Overall Compass offers  a well balanced package."

Riding experience: Really good powerful car with great roo for familyDetails about looks, performance etc: IT HAS AN AMAZING LOOK WHICH CANNOT BE COMPARED TO ANY OTHER CAR IN THAT SEGMENTPros and Cons: It would be better if you open a showroom in mangalore

I bought my Jeep Compass year ago, ride quality seems good I wonâ€™t itâ€™s Suberb cause rear seat comfort is not so good, I love the way the jeep looks the front Day time running LED is a killer! 2.0 Multijet engine is making the jeep more unique a say cause 180bhp and 350 NM torque and decent mileage trust me or not I got 18kms on highway! Touch screen navigation is responsive but well not as responsive as fordâ€™s touch screen! Maintaince is on higher side I mean itâ€™s bit costly obviously itâ€™s jeep!  Pros: great engine, looks are stunning even better fuel efficiency than rivals like fortuner and endover. Cons: rear ride comfort is not so good and maintaince and cruise control is big miss as well
It's amazing look ,I want buy this car in after my job. That's my favorite car and brands. jeep brand is power drift and cool feature mode.its comfortable car and good space . mileage is very good, fuel economy card, high range car is a suitable price for people, work and maintenance cost not high..NANA

"1. It a value for money product for sure due to its class and the performance it generate.

2. Great comfort in terms of interior provided and it also provides very light handling in respect to suvâ€™s.

3. Have Aesthetics looks and off road driving is at par.

4. The amount that goes in service is totally worth full."
"It's very good looking car So must important car suv in the life and the many features in the car . So i choose and bought the JEEP.
I bought the top model in jeep in JEEP COMPASS LIMITED PLUS"
I bought jeep last year in may and it has been a blissful one year of ownership. To say the least, the JEEP has forced to make time frim my work and start living that collegue life of long drives with those never ending talks and discussions about life once again. It is a monster of an engine and the sleek gear box with that great aluminium finish round gear box is so silky smooth. Of course, there are some niggles but that cannot take away the sheer joy it gives me everytime I am behind the wheels. It is an epitome of go anywhere kind of freedom.
Very Awesome LookingÂ Car, Good Space Comfort And Good Body I Love It. Jeep Company Power Full Engine Very Awesome.NANA
Very bad experience with jeep compass my car clutch changed at 15000 km . They only give one year warranty of battery if buy this car you hv to buy battery after one year for sure . Bt the same company Exide gives its 4 yr warranty they frauding people . Loss of money buying this car
Details about looks, performance It's look very super and excellent performance. Very huge space and. good interior systemsNANA
"I bought the jeep compass limited 4Ã—4 in july under there upgrade plan for 4Ã—4. So i purchased the car at a price of 23 lac instead of 25 lac on road. 
One thing i would i to say is that this is the beast when it comes to pure driving experience. No suv under 35 lac can beat it in terms of performance. I have one problem regarding some features  but many of them has already been included in the limited plus trim at a cost of 2 lac more, so no issue of that also.
My only suggestion to Jeep india is to price the longitude option model at 21 lac on road because of the newely arrived harrier. And please launch a diesel automatic in limited trim. If they do this than definitely there sales will reach around 1800 units a month.

My suggestion to customer is if you are planning for a SUV and your budget is over 21-22 lac than definitely go for compass. But if your budget is tight around 18-19 lac than go for harrier XZ over creta and other. 
Remember one thing only the XZ model of harrier is good to purchase because the rest of models lacks safety features which are on my priority number 1."
"I took loan from bank and bought this car.
It's like a beast for both off and on road .
It's a fashionable SUV and beautiful stearing wheel with comfortable handling.
Value of money"

I live in Gujrat. I had an Honda City Petrol. I took this while twice to Manali. The fuel expenses was a lithke bit higher but the feel was good. Then I tot for a SUV which would be powerful and can meet my driving craze. I zeroed in on JEEP. I took it to Goa and just few days back I took it to Ooty and then Kerala with my family. The drive was fantastic. The performance of this vehicle is too good. U will nvr feel it is leaving the road. I recommend only Jeep. My total running is 7350 Kms. No complaint yet.
"Firstly the parts of the car is not at all good, what I come to know later is that this company is a Chinese one and just to make mark in India they registered as UK based company which is very much false. 
If you can check in the internet you can come to know that Chinese hold major shares in the company and the parts used to build the car is manufactured in China which you all know how quality will that China cheap parts be!"

MG HECTOR is one of the best and fully loaded SUV,  which was provided at lower cost in all variants. Ride quality and looks also good. Comfortable seats, paramonic sunroof, inside internet and AC performance fabulous.                                                                                     .                                     .
Pls donâ€™t buy this car .. there is problem in clutch plate and that is not getting to solve .. making fool . Just the looks given in car .. performance vise very poor .. I will suggest go for Kia motors much better .. I am regretting buying mj hector
"Buying Experience: 
Only one dealer in entire Telangana and most of the staff is straight from college. Over & above overwhelming bookings . Now you can imagine the customer experience. Heard some customers are using all possible recommendations to speed up their delivery. You can imagine the rest.

Riding Experience: 
I drove MG Hector (Sharp) Petrol Hybrid for more than 1000kms. Both in city traffic (200km) and on national highway (800km). It gives superior comfort for driver/passengers . HiTech features makes you feel like you are in full control of the car. No complaints in this section. Over all I am very happy. 

Details about look: I liked the external design of the car. For me it appears like a mini Toyota Fortuner from some angles. 

Performance: 
After driving it in different roads in city & highways, I don't feel the acceleration is leaner enough in all gears. Overall I felt it is ""sluggish"" / ""under powered"" . I am not an auto expert to give figures on RPM vs Torque etc. Even the fuel efficiency is not up to the figures declared by MG India (i.e. 15.8 kmpl). I only got 9 to 10 kmpl in city & 11 to 13kmpl in Highways. 

Finally I would like to say this car is a good value for money."
"I got a chance to Drive this Car . I didn't Expect That the petrol Hybrid Engine Gives This Type of power. This Engine Really Awesome. The 1.5 ltr Hybrid Engine Gives a lot of Power in the Mid-range Up to 2000 rpm some amount of lag but its pull so Quickly. And The safety features of this car is Very good 6 Airbag Abs EBD TC Hill hold etc.
The Design of this Car is Awesome And The comfort also Very Good The Rear Passenger Gets Rear Arm Rest Rear Ac Vents and Good Amount of Space. And The Main Attraction of this Car Internet Inside 10.4 inch Huge Touch screen It's Really Awesome The Sound Quality Is Also Great .
Pros 
1. Value for Money 
2. Fully Loaded By the Way of Features In this Price like Panoramic Sunroof, 10 inch Touch screen With Android Auto And Apple Car Play With 5G Sim Support, Electrically Adjustable Driver seat Etc 
3. Safety 
Cons 
1. The Breaking is Okey Not that Great"
"The overall genuine review must-read who want to buy this car

1. My buying exp. Is awesome the showroom people were very polite and responsible. And I opted for black mg hector top-end diesel

2. I have already done 20000 kms in 4 months and at first, there is a clutch issue and I thought this was a bad car but it isn't the company replaced my clutch with a dust cover not it is riding excellently and on Hyderabad ring road I've hit 185kmph and it feels like going 100 kmph inside the cabin there is 0 vibration and noises....overall very nice.

3. The looks were Mind boggling just awesome the black was insane.when it comes to performance in 2nd gear the power was lacking but overall the performance was brilliant absolutely no doubt

4.pros and cons
PROS
*Stunning looks
*Great power
*Roomy cabin
*Amazing features
*Cheaper price for that car i would pay min. 25 lack for that car

CONS
*STEERING WOULD HAVE MORE FEEL AND FEEDBACK BUT ITS FINE WHEN WE GAIN SPEED.

THAT'S IT."
"Mg hector is one of the best suv segment car in india.it is basically competition with harrier,creata and jeep pros:it has good pickup
2.it has smooth drive.
Cons:1 isssue with voice command either it doesn't recognize or it listen to what you talks
2.display touch -it display is not responding sometimes
3.cooling issue in the rear section ac is not much effective as it has panaromic sunroof it has high temperature in rear section cooling is not effective in summer.
 4.battery is not so good thats why mg provide one year warranty on that."
"Buying experience: Sales number define the gravity of the car and flock of customer booking.

Riding experience: one of the worst experience as the acceleration is worst in the segment. I bet if you take this in traffic it will take her two second just to respond.

Details: well tough it's an internet car and first in the segment. The only feature enactment is voice command worthy enough to test. Well didn't they just fit an ipad. It feels like a copied version. Also the screen frickles while it was standing at showroom they ac touchbar went flickering. It's a common thing for a car to have a dc electronic convertor for a car standing at showroom but this happed with the car too. Maybe they require a software update
the right side, the bonut is not aligned to the body. So there might be an assembly issue to with the car. 

Honestly, I went to buy with confidence. But that engine ruined by decision. It's not responsive at all. And the assembly thing might cause vibration in future with my experience."
"This car is nothing but a cheap quality chinese car the petrol hybrid version is waste and its lack much power .... This version of the car is low on power and according to the massive expensive price range .... Jeep compass is much better option .....I was thinking of selling my jeep compass when i saw MG but after riding it i regret my descision ..... I chose to keep using my jeep compass for another 1 year instead of buying This RUBBISH MG HECTOR ......
FIRST of all this same car is provided to different car brands in the world so it no unique 
This car is provided to the Brands like
CHEVROLET
BAOJUN 350
WULING ALMAZ
Type this on net and you will find this same car with different badging ..... I REGRET EVEN DRIVING IT ......IN the end its your money your choice ....."
"Full Luxury car with all features
Best in Class
But 
Diesel has some problem 
Fuel pump noise after Long drive
Engine different noise like something 
That touching in starting time
This noise you found the noise when the glass is down
You found dashboard sound
MG Looks at this type of problem 
N solve it to make this car no 1
All this type of problem I see when meeting one of mg customer he live in noida
He buy this hector diesel top model from agra
He have red hector facing the problem of noise when he start the car 
Sound of fuel pump 
And also after  3 months gone the registration of his car is not done after paying the advance registration fee
I found at the time of test drive 
Dashboard sound 
Mg must go through this type of problem which his customer is facing"
This is a China car I have used this car for a short period of time for one month and there were some small scratch on the bumper while driving I scratched a small post and I wanted to repair it so I went to the MG work shop and I asked a claim in the warranty and they refused it and they said that paint is not included in the warranty and I asked the price for painting they said it is 50,000 only I got angry and I left the place and I canâ€™t accept that for a cheap China car I should give this much money this car is not worth and itâ€™s cheap plastic interiors and I exchanged it and bought a Honda CR-V
This car being new entrant has been set at the right price between Creta and Harrier. Comparatively has a lot on offer especially features and technology. Really like the tire temperature indicators. UI on main head unit is a bit slower. Hope they will update it soon. Not very good for offroading as the over hang is too much reducing approach angle from both ends. Tired are a size smaller compared to the overall size of this SUV. Bus quality is very good and have passed crash test with 5*. Overall it's at the best price. Long term reliability is still a question mark and to cover that MG are providing 5 years unlimited mileage warranty, I believe that comes at an add-on price.
"I'm honestly advising not to buy this car right now.  
Connectivity feature is a crap.Poor build quality. Touchscreen is really lagging.Voice recognition not working best as expected. Comfort and space is awesome. Keep in mind it's not like a SUV, it works like an MPV. Harrier is he best alternative"
"I have booked this car in June in Gurgaon after reading review at CarWale.com before they announced even prices and they told me that they will Delever car by July and took our advance , now they say that they will delever in September and there is no reasons , 
They are selling cars by taking some premium and this is my concern 
I am thinking to cancel it now"
Worst Car, The mileage in city is 6.1 on highway 7.2, Huge power loss when you want acceleration, AC not effective, worst experience while driving uphill, please don't buy, also recommended to cancel your booking, if you want a genuine test drive please mail me at mayank@%*%%***%*.**.inNANA
"I was reading the reviews mentioned on the portal and there was one review by Mr. Nishant Rao who claimed to have bought the car 2 weeks before the official deliveries started and gave full detailed review explaining how everything about this car is negative.
This was a classic example of negative marketing from the people associated with other brands.

MG has done a commendable work to start their innings in India. They are providing a extraordinary package with the aggressive pricing.
It remains to see how the car performs and time.shall make it clear.

As of now, Hector is quite impressive.

P.S. beware of fake reviews"
"Itâ€™s over priced by company after waiting Of 3 months.
No one Trust new company in India. They should make prices lower to Hyundai creta etc., since people donâ€™t hv experience 

Smart India 
Smart people"
"I booked MG hector on 19th of July, 2019. I opted for Smart DCT, (Aurora Silver) at MGâ€™s Showroom Ahmedabad which is owned by Concept Motors.

I had driven MG hector before booking the car itself. But after booking it I still wanted a test drive. I was with the same Sales person from whom I booked the car. I was just cruising around on the service road, when there was a sudden thud in the engine. The car stopped immediately after that. I had to put it in 2nd Manual so that car started moving again. There was no response from the car in any other gears. I tried to manually adjust in 1-3-4-R none of them worked. In any of the gears other than 2nd I would see an orange coloured exclamation mark on the information cluster. The sales person told that there was some issue in the transmission. He called some guy from the tech team and found out the transmission had failed. The car had only 4200km on the test runs. 

I cancelled the booking very next day to which their manager told me to wait for a few days until we find what the issue was in regards to. But as I was adamant they proceeded with the refund. While booking they had promised to refund in 15 days though it took them 28 days to process it through and give me the cheque that too after alot of follow ups. 

The car is good on cosmetics, but I donâ€™t think so that you can rely on the engine in the long run. MG still needs to refine the Engine according to the Indian roads. Giving variety of features wonâ€™t help if there is an issue with the Engine Quality."
It's a beautiful suv design wise, no doubt about it. However the steering control is poor. The screen doesn't respond properly to the commands. Tyres look very small. Interior finish is ok type. Driver seats are adjustable but not comfortable. Worst part is the curtain of sunroof, which looks like a mosquito net, very thin. Front and back parts are made up of cheap plastic. A true Chinese product, you will be lured by beauty but actual performance is poor. Less service network, nil resale value.
It's look is amazing. It's engine is too powerful. It's suitable for me for long and short trips. It was very easy to buy it. It is too much smooth to drive. I would recommend everyone to buy MG Hector.
"Good interest features but engine performance not good as harrier and jeep compass. And design is not good as tata harrier and jeep compass
Good interest features but engine performance not good as harrier and jeep compass. And design is not good as tata harrier and jeep compass. I suggest u to buy harrier"
Looking amazing a really a smart car a wonderful er car. I want to buy . No competition no comparatively in this budget. the ride is the very comfortable price is very low and features is very excellent....NANA
It was good to have the car. Great comfort and style. Family is enjoying the ride during long drives. Safety is a plus point for this new machine. Colours are eye catching and vibrant

"This is the best car under this price it come with full feature loaded suv under 20 lakh and gives a tough compitition to cars of this segment.  The app control the style body design build quality and mny more other features make it a perfect car. The large and
Huge panoramic sunroof is awesome the touch screen the 360 degrer parking camera i am in love witj this vehicle"
"It was quite exciting and joyful experience driving this amazing car.it is fully paisawasool car.looks are quite good and modern.tecnology car.

It is fully paisawasool car and one should go for it"
"Itâ€™s great price to buy compare to Hyundai venue, Honda BRV or Hyundai Creta
I love the panoramic moonroof 
DCT Petrol power with turbo charge .
Best view and ground clearance is perfect"
"No doubtly this car is going to shake the whole market because it has more features ,but overall the IMHO I do not liked the design at all
I still consider harrier or compass is better that how they looks 
This car is filled with a lot of features 
But sometimes these features will annoy you 
Like ""hello MG ""
These are all gimmicky things to attract more and more audience..
Infact the seating of harrier is way better than the Hector 
Underthigh support is missing 
And the elements are copy from other manufacturers too!
Like the rear is fully copied from Audi 
The infortainment system copied from Volvo
Instrument cluster copied from Aston Martin 
To much coping from each other 
And at the end CHINESE ARE FAMOUS FOR COPING THINGS 
Overall the car is decent not so great ."
Great good looking in any others cars low cost of maintenance very carefully futures in this vehicle very comfortable in car awesome tripe tk manli no any other person like this one is the best thing Air-condition is cool one someone that has been checked my first choice to get back in touch soonNANA
"Yes I would consider to buy this car
Very good in terms of driving experience
Top end modle has good safety features with very low price range it's a budget friendly car
New in market so can't say about it's service and maintenance
Highly equipped with  Good safety features budget friendly car 
Safety comes first"
Look wise so good and performance is also better than other SUV. This car fuel efficiency is better than  other same segments. The car is totally awesome. Loads of  features and competition to other brands. This car being new entrant has been set at the right price  than other cars. Overall it's at the best price.
Little long waiting period but worth to wait awsum sun roof interiors and Bluetooth systems which makes it completely flawless. Best in Mileage also adds up to stylish looks and comfort wise also
"Its look is amazing, interior super and  in Indian markets first internet car , overall this car worth to buy  ,but I am waiting for 7 seater,  ok thanks to  MG for a super duper car , 
              When to expect 7 seater in Indian market , please let me know , i am huge fan of mg  ,    Does MG Hector consist of a Hybrid variant"
"I just want to say this is the best car and it's worth buying this car.....price is awesome....instead of investing of fortuner or creta buy this
Its is a new car just planning for a long drive .....I hope I get a good service"
It's looking very nice. Spacious. Very fabulous. According to price this car is value for money. it's real XUV car. I want to suggest to all users please please when you plan to purchase car in 12 to 14 lakh  so first see it.
Excellent car for a family purpose. When I saw this car at a first time I was attract towards it. It's interior and exterior both are excellent. Or I was not soure about the engine.

"I'm from a small village in rajasthan. I like this car so much...some peoples see MG Hector in advertisements on TV. After knowing its features many peoples like this & want to replace his cars with MG hector...its voice controlled system is great....really I recommend everyone to buy MG Hector. I also want to buy this one after 1 month. Then I will update my review with all my experiences.
Without touching this car I m confident mG Hector is best....thank you."
A very nice and very intelligent car. I reccomend you to buy this car This is a pretty and awesome looking car. Best car to buy and we can give upto a 100 of commands and it will follow...
It's an excellent car with a lot of features. And the price is too low compared to the features and facilities. I had driven the top end diesel model car. It is very comfort to drive long kilometres(long drive). I would like to buy it but the booking is now stopped. Its a superb car a small family and its boot space is the main highlight
Hi, i am Intereating MG Hector, last one month i watching  mg hector in youtube all model. My experince this mg is the best car. I hope and i buying this car between 3 or 4 months. MG Hector model deserve inthe best model really i like this car and i Fainlly deceided  buying  this car and Comperison another cars

I love this SUV it looks very sharp and comfortable and is so fast and the company is giving good service Jai Shree Ram.The car is so features like 360.degree camera.it is better than scorpio ,harrier.
"It's seems like very good, worth of money
I would like to prefer you all to go through this car once. Buying procedures takes little bit of time, but overall I think it is good. Best for the long journeys in this price ranges of SUV vehicles. Better than orther SUV vehicles. It's look is good enough and have one of the best look in this price range, it's colours textures are good, colours variant are also good. It's overall look is very good. It's headlamps and backlamps are look very gorgeous and stunning. It's curved edges looks very smoothy.
                                  It's performance is best in it's class. It have a very efficient engine installed. And its driving experience is smooth enough. Fuel economy is also good enough but it can better.
                                          In India not a many service centers for this car are available but it will be available soon as I think of. Servicing experience of mine are good enough. In case of price range this car's maintenance cost is not so costly as others in comparison.
                                                                It has very attractive features like very efficient voice command control which can control many of its features. It has a large display which feel premium enough. And all of the others features are available. 
                                                 This car is one of the option in case of comfort."

Blindly go for it.as I had personally checked the car. Their is no doubt that it's the best car in this price segment. and I even don't see a car comparable to it in higher segment also. I purchased this car from sec-8 noida showroom the staff is really good and helpful. The person from whome we purchased car is always ready to help."
It's a wonderful car. It's a very comfortable and spacefull interior design, as well as, as a driver it's giving a luxury feeling. MG Hector is one of the best SUV I aver drive, it's a huge fantastic.
This is the first car in india. I like the car. comfert is very good. I'm very interested in the car. I'm drive the and I'm so impress this car. It's size very Good for Big ride. I'm Loving this car.
it's bull....don't read just try test drive...for this budget  this best and more enough....pls take it seriously....it's better not belive others try ur part ...u will be surely convenced......even majer things car is very much stable at the time of driving faster ..which only PREMIUM car proves...not like budget car
"Only about looking n performance on road. 
I want to see maximum cars on Indian road
Common people can also riding experience . People are more in lines n always fulfill the customer requirements time to time
I thing that common people can also purchase of this dream car.
Always commitment to great service from MG motor"
I had nice experience with this vehicle.. it is just like inside a wonder world with lot of energy to do anything... Materials used in interior is high quality and it gives more comfort and stylish look. E assist is very nice to communicated.. Engine noise is not come to inside and fully noise proofed.
"Drive Hector with Fully trust because smart people ki smarat car meand MG HECtOr.

Unbelivable feature and Unbelivable car wchich introduced in indian market.I hope no one can beat these car at these budget.Hope i will buy my first car whenevr will go for Hector.
Its dream car of my life and i always try to fulfill my dream."
"MG Hector is a very impressive SUV with a sleek look and it's imposing texture. It is comfy and smooth. Though this amazing car weighs 2 tonnes, it has a good pick-up. The engine is powerful and the cabin in quiet. There is a lot of leg room for second row. 
The boot space is remarkable. The car come with one of the best infotainment systems.The voice commands take a little time to activate, but still are impressive.The car has wide wheels which increase the road grip. The fuel efficiency/ milage is not that satisfactory
The top varient is quite expensive but it is worth it.The dealer told me that for Rs.30000, they will take complete maintenance care for 3 years! The infotainment system comes with a prepaid 4 year subscription. So, u r connected with internet anywhere u go.
The panoramic sunroof/moonroof is breath taking and makes us feel good.
In the top varient, u get a 360Â° view, top view, side view, et cetera.
My driving experience was excellent but we don't know about the OFF ROAD Ability of this car.
The only matter of concern is that it is a Chinese car n many Indians don't like tat"
The car is totally awesome.Loads of features and good competition to harrier and xuv500.The car is equal to jeep compass,so its worth buying it.Only problem is these cars are BS4 engines and the delivery of car is nearly on  year 2019 ending.Else the car looks,performance and features are really good for that price.
Best car in this segment amazing car I think this car is better than harrier this car have many features than Tata harrier front look is but mg doing a good job . This car have amazing look with amazing features.
"This car is amazing as because its from MG motors.. i have not bhought the product yet but its in my wish list to buy MG car hector . As this car provide us the futuristic technology and the look of we indians expect like US cars, the MG motor has completed our expectations buy bringing such a beauty to indian roads... Well according to my research on youtube i have got to understand that the quality, performance, practicality,riding comfort is best according to the price range .
Servicing and maintenance might be higher side as afcourse its MG but its worth it.
But there a few things which can be rectified by MG are there lag in music system, low light in spedo meter,back seat underneath support well yh thats it ...
Eagerly w8ing for sedan car by MG .."
"Great features. 
Strong  built than Harrier,xuv500 and Compass.
Spacious  than all its competitors. 
My hector is coming in September .
Hector is going to defeat all its competitors In sales in upcoming mnths may be from August only. This is only a car with voice command in its range. Land rover costing above 50 lacs will give you this feature. 
Finally it's a fantastic car."
"I test ride the vehicle and itâ€™s awesome.... interior design is bit okay but the technology is smart in its kind.... 
Audio playback seating aitbags and many more especially the voice assistant is nice"
"Pros: Loaded with fancy features , not sure how long they will work. 

Cons,: Worst customer service, Chinese made and yet to prove itself which is highly doubtful considering the Chinese made sticker."
"The delivery is very nice and riding experience was awesome and good performance of the engine.
pros: eye catchy
         Nice driving clearence,
         good seat height adjustment."
I drive the MG hector that has many features in it, and it has a lot of performance and it is very easy to use and it is comfortable in the drive. And I think it will become the most famous brand in the upcoming Days.
"I booked a car on july 4th at Naroda dealership. At the time of booking the sales person confidently gave time to deliver car in 2 to 3 months which means mg committed to give car in mid of October. After booking i got call from mg motors that i will get my car in December. Which is double the waiting period. Inshort. Mg motors made fake promise about delivery date and made wrong commitment. Now after 2 months mg motors is saying that you need to
 wait for 4 months more. So disappointed. A new car maker which i trust have broken it.  1st car. Going to cancle the booking. Will never ever buy MG Cars"
"A very amazing suv to drive on ...

It's value for money, it's performance was well, it's with u all the time, it's a human being, it's having a such gud features. Comfortable ride compare to others having well safety, like AIR bags.
This car is value for money and they could have given an hydraulic for the bannet it will be very useful because the bannet heavy other all features all good and unique the internet connected car voice assistance and many more other features in the car like electronic tail gate

This is amazing car ever in my life I have Volvo&s-cross also but this is amazing car.i love it superb Man it's wonderful.NANA
This car is way better than Tata harrier. The only downside is its a new company and service network. But they told  me that they will open showrooms in tier3 cities soon. Coming to the car , the diesel is the same as that of harrier but produces 30 bhp more and claims more FE than harrier that is a win for me. Also even the base model is equipped with hill descent , ebd, and everything that is equipped in the top variant .. it also comes with the factory fitted music system which is not in tata harrier. For the money you pay this has the most value. Also riding comfort is better. Harrier looks funky whereas this looks professional. If they open showroom near my town, i would definitely buy one. Waiting.
Awesome service from service centre no maintenance good mileage awesome car interior design ideas so good also equal to toyota fortuner nd ford endeavour in look its headlight are good
"Everything is very good, showroom service was excellent, 
Very very sporty look.
Display screen and sunroof is something like newly added technology like luxury car.

Only missing thing is it could be 7 seater."
Test Drove the 1.5 Sharp Hybrid Petrol Manual variant. Went to Navi Mumbai showroom last Sunday morning and very quickly was slotted for the TD. From Nerul took the Sion Panvel Highway and drove up to almost Thurbe and back. Accelaration was quite rapid in 3rd gear. went over no -road surface service road near Shirvane. didnt feel the roughs at all. Overall good car. I have booked the Smart Hybrid.
OMG...I got shock then i took one look of this incedible car.. this car funtabulous... every think that i need..  it have..,,not that much costy...look and performes vise better than others , i recommed to myself..to buy this one
Riding experience was excellent and the price was very worthy. Fuel mileage was good. External body was very good.Engine was smooth during riding and seating comfort was very nice.
"Buying experience was very good the salesman conveyed the features in soulful manner. Riding experience of the car was outstanding. the first look of the car was it's appearance was too good
Like service cost was minimal on only up to 10000 I think this car has no cons only pros that is it's features."

Coming to the car , the diesel is the same as that of harrier but produces 30 bhp more and claims more FE than harrier that is a win for me. Also even the base model is equipped with hill descent , hill hold, ESP,cooled glove box,TC,rear defogger and wiper which is a great security feature on hill drives,keyless entry etc .. it also comes with the factory fitted music system which is not in tata harrier. For the money you pay this has the most value. Also riding comfort is better. Harrier looks funky whereas this looks professional. If they open showroom near my town, i would definitely buy one.

"Cool car..i loved this car.. Love it. I recommend it to buy this car. Also it's our young ages car.this car display is massif.
Also it has a lot of features Jiska seat comfort is best of the segment.
This guard has wonderful colours variance this ka room space is Messi top of the signet also discard boot space top notch"
Far ahead of its rivals(harrier and compass) in features and space..high comfort level.. good for comfort and safe driving lovers....not good for harsh riders bcz of its height, car ill topple in sharp cuts ...engine wise same as its rivals 2.0 fiat engine so no compromise ..over all good and fully loaded car with good price tag
This is one of the most futuristic car in this segment.and u feel in the car very luxurious feel gives u.i ts value for money.but one thing  it's look like very big SUV but it 5.seater SUV car this is Disappointing me but otherwise nothing to say about it........
Looks is very nice and fabulous front looks overall and interior is also excellent very spacious for passengers Nd LCD was amazing steering design very good but one thing is I donâ€™t like is that desiel engine is car starting sound is not good thatâ€™s it nice car
